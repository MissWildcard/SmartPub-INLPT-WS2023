by the prevalence of intelligent wearables. It poses a demanding requirement of 
micro-interaction and minimizing social awkwardness. Our previous work 
demonstrated the feasibility of recognizing silent commands through around-ear 
biosensors with the limitation of user adaptation. In this work, we ease the 
limitation by a personalization framework that integrates spectral factorization 
of signals, temporal confidence rejection and commonly used transfer learning 
algorithms. Specifically, we first empirically formulate the user adaptation 
issue by presenting the accuracies of applying transfer learning algorithms to 
our previous method. Second, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio by proposing 
the supervised spectral factorization method that learns the amplitude and phase 
mappings between around-ear signals and the signals of articulated facial 
muscles. Third, we leverage the time continuity of commands and introduce the 
time decay into confidence rejection. Finally, extensive experiments have been 
conducted to evaluate the feasibility and improvements. The results indicate an 
average accuracy of 92.38% which is significantly larger than solely using 
transfer learning algorithms. And a comparable accuracy can be achieved with 
significantly reduced data of new users. The overall performance shows the 
framework can significantly improve the accuracy of user adaptations. The work 
would aid a further step toward commercial products for silent command

Strategies of Pathologists.","Li J, Cheng J, Meng L, Yan H, He Y, Shi H, Guan T, Han A.","Digitization of pathological slides has promoted the research of computer-aided 
diagnosis, in which artificial intelligence analysis of pathological images 
deserves attention. Appropriate deep learning techniques in natural images have 
been extended to computational pathology. Still, they seldom take into account 
prior knowledge in pathology, especially the analysis process of lesion 
morphology by pathologists. Inspired by the diagnosis decision of pathologists, 
we design a novel deep learning architecture based on tree-like strategies 
called DeepTree. It imitates pathological diagnosis methods, designed as a 
binary tree structure, to conditionally learn the correlation between tissue 
morphology, and optimizes branches to finetune the performance further. To 
validate and benchmark DeepTree, we build a dataset of frozen lung cancer 
tissues and design experiments on a public dataset of breast tumor subtypes and 
our dataset. Results show that the deep learning architecture based on tree-like 
strategies makes the pathological image classification more accurate, 
transparent, and convincing. Simultaneously, prior knowledge based on diagnostic 
strategies yields superior representation ability compared to alternative 
methods. Our proposed methodology helps improve the trust of pathologists in

the demands of high-quality speech analysis, manipulation, and synthesis. 
However, most existing works focus on how to synthesize normal human voice with 
high signal-to-noise ratio, neglecting individuals' pathological voice disorder 
in speech interaction. In this work, we propose a non-linear voice repair 
vocoder for pathological vowels and sentences, which takes the pathological 
speech as input and generates high-quality repaired speech. Our approach is 
specifically designed to enhance the speech quality and intelligibility for 
individuals with voice disorders. We employ amplitude modulated-frequency 
modulated (AM-FM) and Teager energy operation techniques to enhance the quality 
of pitch and spectral envelope. To tackle the instability and fracture problem 
of pitch, we present spectral tracking algorithm, which not only avoids dramatic 
change in the edge of voice, but also reduces the errors of half-pitch. 
Furthermore, we design a spectral reconstruction algorithm, which can 
effectively rebuild the spectral structure by energy operation to accomplish 
spectral envelope repair. The proposed PVR-Vocoder shows exceptional performance 
in pathological voice intelligibility enhancement according to various quality 
measures including objective indicators, subjective evaluation, and spectrum

Nicolle et Manceaux, 1908, are known to affect the behaviour and mental health 
of their animal and human hosts. Both pathogens infect a significant fraction of 
human population, both are neurotropic and survive in the host's body for a long 
time. While latent infections were thought to be clinically asymptomatic, recent 
studies suggest otherwise, revealing adverse effects on human health. It was 
hypothesised that the specific behavioural effects of these pathogens may be 
side effects of general health impairments in infected individuals. This 
hypothesis was tested using about one hour-long survey consisting of 
questionnaires and performance tests on a cohort of 7,762 members of the 
internet population. Results showed that individuals infected with T. gondii 
reported worse physical and mental health, and those infected with Borrelia spp. 
reported worse physical health than uninfected controls. Furthermore, infected 
and noninfected individuals differed in several personality traits, including 
conscientiousness, pathogen disgust, injury disgust, Machiavellianism, 
narcissism, tribalism, anti-authoritarianism, intelligence, reaction time, and 
precision. While the majority of behavioural effects associated with Borrelia 
infection were similar to those associated with Toxoplasma infection, some 
differences were observed, such as performance in the Stroop test. Path analyses

brain, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved unprecedented classification 
performance. But they still cannot outperform many artificial neural networks. 
Modularity is another crucial feature of the biological brain. It remains 
unclear if modularity can also improve the performance of SNNs. To investigate 
this idea, we proposed the modular SNN, and compared its performance with a 
uniform SNN without modularity by employing them to classify cortical spike 
trains. For the first time, a significant improvement was found in our modular 
SNN. Further, we probed into the factors influencing the performance of the 
modular SNN and found: (a). The modular SNN outperformed the uniform SNN more 
significantly when the number of neurons in the networks increased; (b). The 
performance of the modular SNNs increased as the number of modules dropped. 
These preliminary but novel findings suggest that modularity may help develop 
better artificial intelligence and brain-machine interfaces. Also, the modular 
SNN may serve as a model for the study of neuronal spike synchrony.","DOI: 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340358

Improves the Quality of Synthetic Histopathology Images for Digital Pathology.","Daniel N, Aknin E, Larey A, Peretz Y, Sela G, Fisher Y, Savir Y.","Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the promise to 
revolutionize the field of digital pathology. However, these models demand 
considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data 
is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and 
validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular 
features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing 
conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an 
input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact 
cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict 
regions of cell types. This is also the case for non-small cell lung cancer, the 
most common type of lung cancer. Deciding whether a patient would receive 
immunotherapy depends on quantifying regions of stained cells. However, using 
polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images - 
due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this 
work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate 
spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the 
quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic 
images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the 
images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the 
appropriate noise frequency yields 87% of the similarity metrics improvement 
that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that 
the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these

by ultrasound (US). However, this process is challenging due to the low quality

needle simultaneously, making it largely reliant on the surgeon's expertise. 
Some previous works employing collaborative robots emerged to improve the 
precision of biopsy interventions, providing an easier, safer, and more 
ergonomic procedure. However, for these equipment to be able to navigate around 
the breast autonomously, 3D breast reconstruction needs to be available. The 
accuracy of these systems still needs to improve, with the 3D reconstruction of

this work is to develop a method to obtain a robust 3D reconstruction of the

compute the robot's trajectories for the biopsy. To this end, depth estimation 
techniques will be developed, based on a deep learning architecture constituted

their relatives. Mobile robotic technologies enable intelligent wheelchairs to 
regain mobility for those affected. Multiple research projects address human 
aware navigation and the task of following a person for assistive robots. But 
just a few projects focus on accompanying a person to enable social interaction. 
Therefore, we present a navigation system for indoor navigation in dynamic and 
cluttered environments as well as a novel algorithm for accompanying a 
person.First, we developed an autonomous driving wheelchair for indoor 
navigation based on the robot operating system (ROS). Thereby, a multi sensor 
setup using cameras and laser scanner enables localization within a map. People 
are detected by the same sensors and tracked by a Kalman filter. Afterwards we 
propose a novel algorithm to achieve a dynamic accompanying behaviour. An 
attractiveness distribution is introduced to evaluate the possible accompanying 
positions next to the manually selected target person regarding social 
interaction. The resulting two-dimensional optimization problem is solved by a 
novel multimodal extension of the A* algorithm.The proposed intelligent 
wheelchair is able to navigate in indoor environments and to accompany any 
person. In addition it allows social interaction while walking to relieve 
relatives or nursing staff, which otherwise need to push the wheelchair. The aim

potential to automate and improve various tasks, such as image analysis and 
diagnostic decision-making. Yet, the inherent variability of tissues, together 
with the need for image labeling, lead to biased datasets that limit the 
generalizability of algorithms trained on them. One of the emerging solutions 
for this challenge is synthetic histological images. Debiasing real datasets 
require not only generating photorealistic images but also the ability to 
control the cellular features within them. A common approach is to use 
generative methods that perform image translation between semantic masks that 
reflect prior knowledge of the tissue and a histological image. However, unlike 
other image domains, the complex structure of the tissue prevents a simple 
creation of histology semantic masks that are required as input to the image 
translation model, while semantic masks extracted from real images reduce the 
process's scalability. In this work, we introduce a scalable generative model, 
coined as DEPAS (De-novo Pathology Semantic Masks), that captures tissue 
structure and generates high-resolution semantic masks with state-of-the-art 
quality. We demonstrate the ability of DEPAS to generate realistic semantic maps 
of tissue for three types of organs: skin, prostate, and lung. Moreover, we show 
that these masks can be processed using a generative image translation model to 
produce photorealistic histology images of two types of cancer with two 
different types of staining techniques. Finally, we harness DEPAS to generate 
multi-label semantic masks that capture different cell types distributions and 
use them to produce histological images with on-demand cellular features.

of generating synthetic histological images while controlling their semantic

collected from 50 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. The 
neuropsychological battery evaluated performance in various domains, including 
episodic memory, fluid intelligence, attention, working memory, executive 
function, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and processing speed. Emotional 
measures were also included to assess emotion recognition and negative affects 
(sadness, fear, and anger). A multivariate approach was adopted to evaluate the

spatiotemporal features of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). The results 
were explored at a false discovery rate-corrected threshold of p < 0.05. There 
was a significant positive association between within-network connectivity of

combining both classes of variants showed that the effects of rare CNVs and

cognitive ability. Despite imparting mostly additive effects on ASD risk, rare 
CNVs and PRS-IQ showed opposing effects on core and associated features and 
developmental history among subjects with ASD. Our findings suggest that 
cognitive ability itself may not be the factor driving the underlying risk for

Recognition in IoT Healthcare Devices.","Patro KK, Prakash AJ, Sahoo JP, Routray S, Baihan A, Samee NA, Huang G.","The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring 
system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome 
characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all 
ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality 
of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program 
so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual 
effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure 
activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in 
real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure 
patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated 
computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this 
work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional 
convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an 
attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through 
EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of 
EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The 
proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure 
recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and 
one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the 
suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG 
recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification 
distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed 
intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of 
Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.","DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3336935

due to the increasing need for identifying outliers in various engineering 
applications that undergo environmental adaptations. Consequently, researchers 
have focused on developing robust AD methods to enhance system performance. The 
primary challenge faced by AD algorithms lies in effectively detecting unlabeled 
abnormalities. This study introduces an adaptive evolutionary autoencoder 
(AEVAE) approach for AD in time-series data. The proposed methodology leverages 
the integration of unsupervised machine learning techniques with evolutionary 
intelligence to classify unlabeled data. The unsupervised learning model 
employed in this approach is the AE network. A systematic programming framework 
has been devised to transform AEVAE into a practical and applicable model. The 
primary objective of AEVAE is to detect and predict outliers in time-series data 
from unlabeled data sources. The effectiveness, speed, and functionality 
enhancements of the proposed method are demonstrated through its implementation. 
Furthermore, a comprehensive statistical analysis based on performance metrics 
is conducted to validate the advantages of AEVAE in terms of unsupervised AD.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3337243

Expertise.","Cox RL, Hunt KL, Hill RR.","BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize 
nursing education. This study compared NCLEX-RN questions generated by AI and 
those created by nurse educators.
METHOD: Faculty of accredited baccalaureate programs were invited to 
participate. Likert-scale items for grammar and clarity of the item stem and 
distractors were compared using Mann-Whitney U, and yes/no questions about 
clinical relevance and complex terminology were analyzed using chi-square. A 
one-sample binomial test with confidence intervals evaluated participants' 
question preference (AI-generated or educator-written). Qualitative responses 
identified themes across faculty.
RESULTS: Item clarity, grammar, and difficulty were similar for AI and 
educator-created questions. Clinical relevance and use of complex terminology 
was similar for all question pairs. Of the four sets with preference for one 
item, three were generated by AI.
CONCLUSION: AI can assist faculty with item generation to prepare nursing 
students for the NCLEX-RN examination. Faculty expertise is necessary to refine 
questions written using both methods. [J Nurs Educ. 2023;62(12):679-687.].","DOI: 10.3928/01484834-20231006-07

postsecondary nursing students are needed. Generative artificial intelligence 
(GAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, for automated writing evaluation (AWE) hold 
promise for mitigating challenges associated with scholarly writing instruction

Gorban AN.","Mammalian brains operate in very special surroundings: to survive they have to 
react quickly and effectively to the pool of stimuli patterns previously 
recognized as danger. Many learning tasks often encountered by living organisms 
involve a specific set-up centered around a relatively small set of patterns 
presented in a particular environment. For example, at a party, people recognize 
friends immediately, without deep analysis, just by seeing a fragment of their 
clothes. This set-up with reduced ""ontology"" is referred to as a ""situation."" 
Situations are usually local in space and time. In this work, we propose that 
neuron-astrocyte networks provide a network topology that is effectively adapted 
to accommodate situation-based memory. In order to illustrate this, we 
numerically simulate and analyze a well-established model of a neuron-astrocyte 
network, which is subjected to stimuli conforming to the situation-driven 
environment. Three pools of stimuli patterns are considered: external patterns, 
patterns from the situation associative pool regularly presented to the network 
and learned by the network, and patterns already learned and remembered by 
astrocytes. Patterns from the external world are added to and removed from the 
associative pool. Then, we show that astrocytes are structurally necessary for 
an effective function in such a learning and testing set-up. To demonstrate this 
we present a novel neuromorphic computational model for short-term memory 
implemented by a two-net spiking neural-astrocytic network. Our results show 
that such a system tested on synthesized data with selective astrocyte-induced 
modulation of neuronal activity provides an enhancement of retrieval quality in 
comparison to standard spiking neural networks trained via Hebbian plasticity 
only. We argue that the proposed set-up may offer a new way to analyze, model, 
and understand neuromorphic artificial intelligence systems.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3335450

Z.","Praseodymium (Pr) lasers have achieved outstanding pico- and sub-picosecond 
pulsations covering the near-infrared (NIR) and visible spectral range in recent 
years. However, it has been a stagnant task for more than two decades to 
leapfrog into the sub-100 femtosecond (fs) regime as the Pr gain bandwidths are 
too narrow for their major transition lines. Although the wide tunability at the 
NIR bands in the Pr:YLF crystals has been explored, the spectral tails in these 
transitions suffer severely from weak gains for mode locking, combined with the 
intricate dispersion control to achieve transform-limit formation. In this work, 
we target the Pr:YLF's 895-nm line with a specially designed edge-pass filter to 
balance the gain bandwidth and transitional strength. By deploying a symmetric 
dispersion scheme and tuning with the soft actor-critic artificial intelligence 
(AI) algorithm, we have achieved the pulse duration down to sub-100-fs in a Pr 
laser for the first time. This work also enriches the AI-assisted methodology 
for ultrafast solid-state laser realizations.","DOI: 10.1364/OL.506628

with a large aperture size gives a feasible way for the realization of 
miniaturized spectral imagers which can serve in many civilian and military 
scenarios. Although the aperture size of MEMS-FPFCs in mid-wave and long-wave

via Inter-regional Relation Learning.","Jung W, Jeon E, Kang E, Suk HI.","Deep learning models based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (rs-fMRI) have been widely used to diagnose brain diseases, particularly 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Existing studies have leveraged the functional 
connectivity (FC) of rs-fMRI, achieving notable classification performance. 
However, they have significant limitations, including the lack of adequate 
information while using linear low-order FC as inputs to the model, not 
considering individual characteristics (i.e., different symptoms or varying 
stages of severity) among patients with ASD, and the non-explainability of the 
decision process. To cover these limitations, we propose a novel 
explainability-guided region of interest (ROI) selection (EAG-RS) framework that 
identifies non-linear high-order functional associations among brain regions by 
leveraging an explainable artificial intelligence technique and selects 
class-discriminative regions for brain disease identification. The proposed 
framework includes three steps: (i) inter-regional relation learning to estimate 
non-linear relations through random seed-based network masking, (ii) explainable 
connection-wise relevance score estimation to explore high-order relations 
between functional connections, and (iii) non-linear high-order FC-based 
diagnosis-informative ROI selection and classifier learning to identify ASD. We 
validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by conducting experiments 
using the Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, demonstrating 
that the proposed method outperforms other comparative methods in terms of 
various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we qualitatively analyzed the selected 
ROIs and identified ASD subtypes linked to previous neuroscientific studies.","DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2023.3337362

soreness and waist and neck alignment problems. In this study, we proposed an 
intelligent sitting posture detection system that uses depth cameras fixed on a 
chair to capture depth images of the user's sitting posture, and then applies a 
trained artificial intelligence (AI) model on an embedded Raspberry Pi board to 
recognize the user's sitting posture from the image data. Finally, through 
Bluetooth on the Raspberry Pi, the results are sent to the user's smartphone 
application for display and recording to achieve rapid detection of sitting 
posture and warning of poor sitting posture. The contribution of this study is 
its use of two depth cameras mounted on a chair, thereby eliminating the problem 
of cumbersome sensors that compromise user comfort or are prone to damage. The 
detection of the user's entire sitting posture was completed on an edge 
computing platform, which leads to power savings and offers privacy protection. 
Furthermore, because of the low battery power usage, the system is portable. To 
perform quick AI calculations, we developed a lightweight EfficientNet model and 
programmed it for the Raspberry Pi. The system achieved an accuracy of 99.71%

Enhancing Transparency and Trustworthiness of IoMT.","Liu W, Zhao F, Shankar A, Maple C, Peter JD, Kim BG, Slowik A, Parameshachari 
BD, Lv J.","Medical image analysis plays a crucial role in healthcare systems of Internet of 
Medical Things (IoMT), aiding in the diagnosis, treatment planning, and 
monitoring of various diseases. With the increasing adoption of artificial 
intelligence (AI) techniques in medical image analysis, there is a growing need 
for transparency and trustworthiness in decision-making. This study explores the 
application of explainable AI (XAI) in the context of medical image analysis 
within medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) to enhance transparency and 
trustworthiness. To this end, this study proposes an explainable framework that 
integrates machine learning and knowledge reasoning. The explainability of the 
model is realized when the framework evolution target feature results and 
reasoning results are the same and are relatively reliable. However, using these 
technologies also presents new challenges, including the need to ensure the 
security and privacy of patient data from IoMT. Therefore, attack detection is 
an essential aspect of MCPS security. For the MCPS model with only sensor 
attacks, the necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting attacks are given 
based on the definition of sparse observability. The corresponding attack 
detector and state estimator are designed by assuming that some IoMT sensors are 
under protection. It is expounded that the IoMT sensors under protection play an 
important role in improving the efficiency of attack detection and state 
estimation. The experimental results show that the XAI in the context of medical 
image analysis within MCPS improves the accuracy of lesion classification, 
effectively removes low-quality medical images, and realizes the explainability 
of recognition results. This helps doctors understand the logic of the system's 
decision-making and can choose whether to trust the results based on the 
explanation given by the framework.","DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3336721

consultation service.","Zhang H, Wang N, Zhang XY, Liu C, Zhang J.","BACKGROUND: The use of telemonitoring electrocardiogram (ECG) improves the 
detection rate of various arrhythmias as it offers an extended recording time 
and does not impose activity restrictions. However, many community hospitals 
lack the resources to conduct this test due to a lack of cardiac function 
specialists and antiquated screening equipment.
OBJECTIVE: To establish a digital ECG telemonitoring system and remote 
consultation service between tertiary hospitals and community medical service 
stations to improve diagnosis and treatment effectiveness.
METHODS: We used the PI ECG telemonitoring data acquisition system, with a 
personal digital assistant (PDA) or computer serving as the platform for ECG 
acquisition, storage, display, printing, and transmission. We introduced this 
system to standardize the storage and transmission of ECG telemonitoring data, 
and ensure accurate transmission, reproducibility, and preservation of data.
RESULTS: The implementation of the PI ECG telemonitoring data acquisition system 
enabled the sharing of remote ambulatory electrocardiography data between 
Beijing Shijitan Hospital and its affiliated community hospitals. This has 
resulted in reduced waiting times for patients to receive reports (from 0.3 to 1 
hour, to 0.1 or less), shortened consultation times (from 2 hours to 0.1 hour), 
and improved patient satisfaction with consultations (> 20% of the patients 
reported they were highly satisfied). The system successfully combined the goals 
of intelligence, real-time synchronization, and efficiency, revolutionizing ECG 
telemonitoring diagnosis in the network era.
CONCLUSION: Sharing digital telematics information between tertiary and 
community hospitals enables a tiered approach to diagnosis and treatment and 
allows for more efficient, accurate, and convenient remote diagnostics.","DOI: 10.3233/THC-230914

Nonvolatile Memory.","Kwon D, Woo SY, Hwang J, Kim H, Bae JH, Shin W, Park BG, Lee JH.","Neuromorphic hardware using nonvolatile analog synaptic devices provides 
promising advantages of reducing energy and time consumption for performing 
large-scale vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) operations. However, the reported 
training methods for neuromorphic hardware have appreciably shown reduced 
accuracy due to the nonideal nature of analog devices, and use conductance 
tuning protocols that require substantial cost for training. Here, we propose a 
novel hybrid training method that efficiently trains the neuromorphic hardware 
using nonvolatile analog memory cells, and experimentally demonstrate the high 
performance of the method using the fabricated hardware. Our training method 
does not rely on the conductance tuning protocol to reflect weight updates to 
analog synaptic devices, which significantly reduces online training costs. When 
the proposed method is applied, the accuracy of the hardware-based neural 
network approaches to that of the software-based neural network after only 
one-epoch training, even if the fabricated synaptic array is trained for only 
the first synaptic layer. Also, the proposed hybrid training method can be 
efficiently applied to low-power neuromorphic hardware, including various types 
of synaptic devices whose weight update characteristics are extremely nonlinear. 
This successful demonstration of the proposed method in the fabricated hardware 
shows that neuromorphic hardware using nonvolatile analog memory cells becomes a 
more promising platform for future artificial intelligence.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3327906

and Few-Shot Learning.","Zhu L, Liu Y, Liu R, Peng Y, Cao J, Li J, Kong W.","Electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) is one of brain computer 
interface (BCI) paradigms, which aims to build a direct communication pathway 
between human brain and external devices by decoding the brain activities. In a 
traditional way, MI BCI replies on a single brain, which suffers from the 
limitations, such as low accuracy and weak stability. To alleviate these 
limitations, multi-brain BCI has emerged based on the integration of multiple 
individuals' intelligence. Nevertheless, the existing decoding methods mainly 
use linear averaging or feature integration learning from multi-brain EEG data, 
and do not effectively utilize coupling relationship features, resulting in 
undesired decoding accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we proposed an 
EEG-based multi-brain MI decoding method, which utilizes coupling feature 
extraction and few-shot learning to capture coupling relationship features among 
multi-brains with only limited EEG data. We performed an experiment to collect 
EEG data from multiple persons who engaged in the same task simultaneously and 
compared the methods on the collected data. The comparison results showed that 
our proposed method improved the performance by 14.23% compared to the 
single-brain mode in the 10-shot three-class decoding task. It demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the proposed method and usability of the method in the context 
of only small amount of EEG data available.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3336356

Economic Agents.","Zhao L, Cai L, Lu WS.","In the rapidly advancing ubiquitous intelligence society, the role of data as a 
valuable resource has become paramount. As a result, there is a growing need for 
the development of autonomous economic agents (AEAs) capable of intelligently 
and autonomously trading data. These AEAs are responsible for acquiring, 
processing, and selling data to entities such as software companies. To ensure 
optimal profitability, an intelligent AEA must carefully allocate its portfolio, 
relying on accurate return estimation and well-designed models. However, a 
significant challenge arises due to the sensitive and confidential nature of 
data trading. Each AEA possesses only limited local information, which may not 
be sufficient for training a robust and effective portfolio allocation model. To 
address this limitation, we propose a novel data trading market where AEAs 
exclusively possess local market information. To overcome the information 
constraint, AEAs employ federated learning (FL) that allows multiple AEAs to 
jointly train a model capable of generating promising portfolio allocations for 
multiple data products. To account for the dynamic and ever-changing revenue 
returns, we introduce an integration of the histogram of oriented gradients 
(HoGs) with the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). This innovative 
combination serves to redefine the representation of local market information to 
effectively handle the inherent nonstationarity of revenue patterns associated 
with data products. Furthermore, we leverage the transform domain of local model 
drifts in the global model update process, effectively reducing the 
communication burden and significantly improving training efficiency. Through 
simulations, we provide compelling evidence that our proposed schemes deliver 
superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including test loss, 
cumulative return, portfolio risk, and Sharpe ratio.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3332315

health. Gastric histopathology images can reliably diagnose related diseases. 
Still, the data volume of histopathology images is too large, making 
misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis easy. The classification model based on deep 
learning has made some progress on gastric histopathology images. However, 
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) generally use pooling 
operations, which will reduce the spatial resolution of the image, resulting in 
poor prediction results. The image feature in previous CNN has a poor perception 
of details. Therefore, we design a dilated CNN with a late fusion strategy 
(DCNNLFS) for gastric histopathology image classification. The DCNNLFS model 
utilizes dilated convolutions, enabling it to expand the receptive field. The 
dilated convolutions can learn the different contextual information by adjusting 
the dilation rate. The DCNNLFS model uses a late fusion strategy to enhance the 
classification ability of DCNNLFS. We run related experiments on a gastric 
histopathology image dataset to verify the excellence of the DCNNLFS model, 
where the three metrics Precision, Accuracy, and F1-Score are 0.938, 0.935, and

Embedded Multistage Reinforcement Learning Approach.","Xiao J, Pisutsin P, Feroskhan M.","Equipping drones with target search capabilities is highly desirable for 
applications in disaster rescue and smart warehouse delivery systems. Multiple 
intelligent drones that can collaborate with each other and maneuver among 
obstacles show more effectiveness in accomplishing tasks in a shorter amount of 
time. However, carrying out collaborative target search (CTS) without prior 
target information is extremely challenging, especially with a visual drone 
swarm. In this work, we propose a novel data-efficient deep reinforcement 
learning (DRL) approach called adaptive curriculum embedded multistage learning 
(ACEMSL) to address these challenges, mainly 3-D sparse reward space exploration 
with limited visual perception and collaborative behavior requirements. 
Specifically, we decompose the CTS task into several subtasks including 
individual obstacle avoidance, target search, and inter-agent collaboration, and 
progressively train the agents with multistage learning. Meanwhile, an adaptive 
embedded curriculum (AEC) is designed, where the task difficulty level (TDL) can 
be adaptively adjusted based on the success rate (SR) achieved in training. 
ACEMSL allows data-efficient training and individual-team reward allocation for 
the visual drone swarm. Furthermore, we deploy the trained model over a real 
visual drone swarm and perform CTS operations without fine-tuning. Extensive 
simulations and real-world flight tests validate the effectiveness and 
generalizability of ACEMSL. The project is available at

With Causal Representation for Robust OOD Generalization.","Zhou X, Zheng X, Shu T, Liang W, Wang KI, Qi L, Shimizu S, Jin Q.","Recently, machine/deep learning techniques are achieving remarkable success in a 
variety of intelligent control and management systems, promising to change the 
future of artificial intelligence (AI) scenarios. However, they still suffer 
from some intractable difficulty or limitations for model training, such as the 
out-of-distribution (OOD) issue, in modern smart manufacturing or intelligent 
transportation systems (ITSs). In this study, we newly design and introduce a 
deep generative model framework, which seamlessly incorporates the information 
theoretic learning (ITL) and causal representation learning (CRL) in a 
dual-generative adversarial network (Dual-GAN) architecture, aiming to enhance 
the robust OOD generalization in modern machine learning (ML) paradigms. In 
particular, an ITL-and CRL-enhanced Dual-GAN (ITCRL-DGAN) model is presented, 
which includes an autoencoder with CRL (AE-CRL) structure to aid the 
dual-adversarial training with causality-inspired feature representations and a 
Dual-GAN structure to improve the data augmentation in both feature and data 
levels. Following a newly designed feature separation strategy, a causal graph 
is built and improved based on the information theory, which can enhance the 
causally related factors among the separated core features and further enrich 
the feature representation with the counterfactual features via interventions 
based on the refined causal relationships. The ITL is incorporated to improve 
the extraction of low-dimensional feature representations and learn the 
optimized causal representations based on the idea of ""information flow."" A 
dual-adversarial training mechanism is then developed, which not only enables 
the generator to expand the boundary of feature distribution in accordance with 
the optimized feature representation from AE-CRL, but also allows the 
discriminator to further verify and improve the quality of the augmented data 
for OOD generalization. Experiment and evaluation results based on an 
open-source dataset demonstrate the outstanding learning efficiency and 
classification performance of our proposed model for robust OOD generalization 
in modern smart applications compared with three baseline methods.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3330864

Learning.","Wei C, Wang Z, Yuan J, Wang X, Liu H, Zhao Q.","Semisupervised human activity recognition (SemiHAR) has attracted attention in 
recent years from various domains, such as digital health and ambient 
intelligence. Currently, it still faces two challenges. For one thing, 
discriminative features may exist among multiple sequences rather than a single 
sequence since activities are combinations of motions involving several body 
parts. For another thing, labeled data and unlabeled data suffer from 
distribution discrepancies due to the different behavior patterns or biological 
conditions of users. For that, we propose a novel SemiHAR method based on 
multitask learning. First, a dimension-based Markov transition field (DMTF) 
technique is designed to generate 2-D activity data for capturing the 
interactions among different dimensions. Second, we jointly consider the user 
recognition (UR) task and the activity recognition (AR) task to reduce the 
underlying discrepancy. In addition, a task relation learner (TRL) is introduced 
to dynamically learn task relations, which enables the primary AR task to 
exploit preferred knowledge from other secondary tasks. We theoretically analyze 
the proposed SemiHAR and provide a novel generalization result. Extensive 
experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SemiHAR 
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3330879

control of intelligent prosthetic hands and other human-machine interaction 
systems. Sonomyography, which can detect the changes in muscle morphology and 
structure precisely, is a promising signal source for fine hand movement 
recognition. However, sonomyography measured by traditional rigid ultrasound 
probes may suffer from poor acoustic coupling because the rigid probe surfaces 
cannot accommodate the curvilinear shape of the human body, particularly in the 
case of small and irregular residual limbs in amputees. In this study, we used a 
self-designed lightweight, flexible, and wearable ultrasound transducer to 
acquire muscle ultrasound images, and proposed a sonomyography transformer 
(SMGT) model for simultaneous recognition of hand movements and force levels. 
The performance of SMGT was systematically compared to two commonly used image 
processing methods, HOG and Gray Gradient, as well as a deep CNN model, in 
simultaneously recognizing ten classes of hand/finger movements and three force 
levels. Additionally, ten subjects including seven non-disabled subjects and 
three trans-radial amputees who are the end users of prosthetic hands were 
recruited to evaluate the effectiveness of SMGT. Results showed that our 
proposed method achieved average classification accuracies of 98.4% ± 0.6% and 
96.2% ± 3.0% in non-disabled subjects and amputee subjects, respectively, which 
are much higher than those of other methods. This study provided a valuable 
approach for ultrasound-based hand motion recognition that may promote the 
applications of intelligent prosthetic hands.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3333008

enabled rehabilitation service systems based on virtual scenarios to provide 
patients with a multi-sensory simulation experience. However, the design methods 
of most rehabilitation service systems rarely consider the 
physician-manufacturer synergy in the patient rehabilitation process, as well as 
the problem of inaccurate quantitative evaluation of rehabilitation efficacy. 
Thus, this study proposes a design method for a smart rehabilitation product 
service system based on virtual scenarios. This method is important for 
upgrading the rehabilitation service system. First, the efficacy of 
rehabilitation for patients is quantitatively assessed using multimodal data. 
Then, an optimization mechanism for virtual training scenarios based on 
rehabilitation efficacy and a rehabilitation plan based on a knowledge graph are 
established. Finally, a design framework for a full-stage service system that 
meets user needs and enables physician-manufacturer collaboration is developed 
by adopting a ""cloud-end-human"" architecture. This study uses virtual driving 
for autistic children as a case study to validate the proposed framework and 
method. Experimental results show that the service system based on the proposed 
methods can construct an optimal virtual driving system and its rehabilitation 
program based on the evaluation results of patients' rehabilitation efficacy at 
the current stage. It also provides guidance for improving rehabilitation 
efficacy in the subsequent stages of rehabilitation services.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3333049

Institute of Child Health and Human Development; 2006–.
2023 Nov 15.","Marine oils, such as fish oil or algal oil, are a rich source of omega-3 fatty 
acids, especially the essential fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Algal oil is high in DHA and low in EPA, whereas 
fish oil has more EPA than DHA. DHA and EPA are normal components of breastmilk 
where concentrations reflect maternal intake. The DHA level in breastmilk is 
typically between 0.2% and 0.3% in Western countries.[1] This is usually 
sufficient to meet the DHA requirements of term breastfed infants, but not the 
higher requirements of preterm infants, where additional maternal 
supplementation is needed.[2] Maternal supplementation increases breastmilk 
levels of DHA and EPA, although it appears that milk concentrations depend more 
on long-term than short-term (past 3-days) intake.[3-5] Higher milk levels 
result in higher infant plasma and erythrocyte levels of omega-3 fatty 
acid-derived phospholipid. One study found that breastmilk DHA was a better 
predictor of infant erythrocyte DHA than direct supplementation of the infants 
with fish oil.[6] Current dietary recommendations for nursing mothers is 250 to 
375 mg daily of DHA plus EPA.[7] Lactating women require a daily dosage of about 
1000 mg DHA plus EPA to reach a milk DHA plus EPA of 1 gram/dL at 4 weeks 
postpartum.[8] Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been studied for 
reduction of postpartum depression in nursing mothers and for improving various 
infant outcomes. A meta-analysis of 35 randomized, controlled trials found that 
women with a diagnosis of severe depression obtained benefit from omega-3 fatty 
acids, but those with mild depression did not.[9] Several meta-analyses have 
been performed on fish oil supplementation during breastfeeding. They found no 
beneficial effect of omega-3-fatty acid supplementation during breastfeeding on 
infant problem-solving ability, intelligence, socioemotional, psychomotor or 
motor development, visual acuity, growth or language development, academic 
performance, risks of attention deficit disorder, attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, or 
depression.[10-13] The most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis found that 
supplementation improved measures of cognitive development in the infant or 
child by 6 to 11%.[13] Two meta-analyses found that maternal supplementation 
with omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids during lactation had little or no 
beneficial effect on childhood allergic diseases.[14,15] A more recent large 
study found that supplementation of nursing mothers with DHA 1.2 grams daily did 
not improve their infants’ neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months of age 
in breastfed, preterm neonates, but subgroup analyses suggested a potential 
benefit for language in preterm neonates born before 27 weeks’ gestational 
age.[16] Although DHA supplementation increases anti-inflammatory components and 
reduced inflammatory prostaglandins in milk, supplementation of mothers with 
preterm infants did not decrease the frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 
36 weeks gestational age.[17,18] Weak evidence for improved vision and attention 
was found in one study.[10,11] Long-term follow-up of a small group of children 
whose mothers received fish oil supplements during lactation found that boys had 
a delayed puberty, shorter average height, and higher systolic blood pressure at 
age 13 years, but no differences in self-rated socioemotional outcomes or 
physical activity at 13 years of age.[19,20] Other studies found that maternal 
fish oil supplementation during pregnancy and lactation reduced oxidative stress 
in their breastfed infants.[21,22] Supplementation of nursing mothers with fish 
oil of about 800 mg of DHA plus EPA for 6 months altered the infant intestinal 
microbiome in a way that might decrease resistance to colonization with 
pathogens. However, no increase in infant illnesses were seen.[23] Infants 
breastfed by overweight or obese mothers who took 3 grams of fish oil daily had 
greater ponderal index and reduced insulin resistance compared to placebo at 3 
months of age.[24] Fish oil up to 3 grams daily is “generally recognized as 
safe” (GRAS) as a food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The most common 
complaint is burping a fishy taste after ingestion. However, breast milk odor is 
not changed by maternal fish oil consumption.[25] Rarely, allergic reactions are 
reported with nut oil-derived omega-3 fatty acids in patients allergic to nuts. 
Dietary supplements do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Manufacturers are responsible to ensure the 
safety, but do not need to prove the safety and effectiveness of dietary 
supplements before they are marketed. Dietary supplements may contain multiple 
ingredients, and differences are often found between labeled and actual 
ingredients or their amounts. A manufacturer may contract with an independent 
organization to verify the quality of a product or its ingredients, but that 
does not certify the safety or effectiveness of a product. Because of the above 
issues, clinical testing results on one product may not be applicable to other 
products. More detailed information about dietary supplements is available 
elsewhere on the LactMed Web site.",PMID: 30000958

Post-Stroke Rehabilitation.","Jin F, Zou M, Peng X, Lei H, Ren Y.","Wearable sensors provide a more effective means of activity monitoring and 
management by recording patients' daily activity data for assessing their daily 
function and rehabilitation progress, as well as providing a convenient and 
practical solution for human activity recognition (HAR). However, during the 
motor rehabilitation of stroke patients, sensors provide vast amounts of 
high-dimensional data that are large and complex. To enhance the accuracy of 
activity monitoring and identification, as well as address the limitations of 
real-time processing, data visualization, and tracking in conventional 
monitoring approaches, it is essential to perform valid data processing and 
analysis. This paper combines deep learning models to explore the potential 
relationships and patterns between data to build an intelligent post-stroke 
rehabilitation system. This paper proposes a novel framework aimed at accurately 
recognizing activities performed by stroke patients. Our approach leverages a 
data fusion mechanism based on multiple sensors to construct a fusion tensor and 
employs a bidirectional long and short-term memory (BiLSTM) network enhanced 
with an attention mechanism. This network effectively captures temporal patterns 
and long-term dependencies within the data, resulting in improved performance 
for wearable sensor-based activity classification. Furthermore, we introduce an 
enhanced loss function to optimize the learning process. To assess the 
performance of the proposed model algorithm, two benchmark datasets were 
employed. These datasets served as the basis for evaluating and comparing the 
baseline method as well as other proposed methods. The experimental results 
clearly demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed the compared methods, 
indicating its superior performance in activity recognition.","DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3332735

10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3329822. Online ahead of print.",Anchor-Enhanced Geographical Entity Representation Learning.,"Chen R, Lei J, Yao H, Li T, Li S.","Geographical entity representation learning (GERL) aims to embed geographical 
entities into a low-dimensional vector space, which provides a generalized 
approach for utilizing geographical entities to serve various geographical 
intelligence applications. In practice, the spatial distribution of geographical 
entities is highly unbalanced; thus, it is challenging to embed them accurately. 
Previous GERL models treated all geographical entities uniformly, resulting in 
insufficient entity representations. To address this issue, this article 
proposes an anchor-enhanced GERL (AE-GERL) model, which utilizes the key 
informative entities as anchors to improve the representations of geographical 
entities. Specifically, AE-GERL develops an anchor selection algorithm to 
identify anchors from large-scale geographical entities based on their spatial 
distribution and entity types. To utilize anchors to guide geographical 
entities, AE-GERL constructs an anchor-enhanced graph to establish explicit 
connections between anchors and nonanchor entities. Finally, a graph neural 
network (GNN) based anchor to nonanchor node learning model is designed to 
impute missing information of nonanchor entities. Extensive experiments are 
conducted on four datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that 
AE-GERL outperforms the baseline models in both sparse and dense scenarios. This 
study provides a methodological reference for embedding geographical entities in 
various geographical applications and also provides an effective approach to 
improve the performance of message-passing-based GNN models.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3329822

Preprint.","Machine Learning Based Identification and Characterization of Mast cells in 
Eosinophilic Esophagitis.","Zhang S, Caldwell JM, Rochman M, Collins MH, Rothenberg ME.","BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is diagnosed and monitored using 
esophageal eosinophil levels; however, EoE also exhibits a marked, understudied 
esophageal mastocytosis.
OBJECTIVE: Using machine learning, we localized and characterized esophageal 
mast cells to decipher their potential role in disease pathology.
METHODS: Esophageal biopsy samples (EoE, control) were stained for mast cells by 
anti-tryptase and imaged using immunofluorescence; high-resolution whole tissue 
images were digitally assembled. Machine learning software was trained to 
identify, enumerate, and characterize mast cells, designated Mast 
Cell-Artificial Intelligence (MC-AI).
RESULTS: MC-AI enumerated cell counts with high accuracy. During active EoE, 
epithelial mast cells increased and lamina propria (LP) mast cells decreased. In 
controls and EoE remission patients, papillae had the highest mast cell density 
and negatively correlated with epithelial mast cell density. Mast cell density 
in the epithelium and papillae correlated with the degree of epithelial 
eosinophilic inflammation, basal zone hyperplasia, and LP fibrosis. MC-AI 
detected greater mast cell degranulation in the epithelium, papillae, and LP in 
EoE patients compared with control individuals. Mast cells were localized 
further from the basement membrane in active EoE than EoE remission and controls 
individuals but were closer than eosinophils to the basement membrane in active 
EoE.
CONCLUSION: Using MC-AI, we identified a distinct population of homeostatic 
esophageal papillae mast cells; during active EoE, this population decreases, 
undergoes degranulation, negatively correlates with epithelial mast cell levels, 
and significantly correlates with distinct histologic features. Overall, MC-AI 
provides a means to understand the potential involvement of mast cells in EoE 
and other disorders.
CLINICAL IMPLICATION: We have developed a methodology for identifying, 
enumerating, and characterizing mast cells using artificial intelligence; this 
has been applied to decipher eosinophilic esophagitis and provides a platform 
approach for other diseases.
CAPSULE SUMMARY: A machine learning protocol for identifying mast cells, 
designated Mast Cell-Artificial Intelligence, readily identified spatially 
distinct and dynamic populations of mast cells in EoE, providing a platform to 
better understand this cell type in EoE and other diseases.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563471

Preprint.","Amplitude modulation perception and cortical evoked potentials in children with 
listening difficulties and their typically-developing peers.","Petley L, Blankenship C, Hunter LL, Stewart HJ, Lin L, Moore DR.","PURPOSE: Amplitude modulations (AM) are important for speech intelligibility, 
and deficits in speech intelligibility are a leading source of impairment in 
childhood listening difficulties (LiD). The present study aimed to explore the 
relationships between AM perception and speech-in-noise (SiN) comprehension in 
children and to determine whether deficits in AM processing contribute to 
childhood LiD. Evoked responses were used to parse the neural origin of AM 
processing.
METHOD: Forty-one children with LiD and forty-four typically-developing 
children, ages 8-16 y.o., participated in the study. Behavioral AM depth 
thresholds were measured at 4 and 40 Hz. SiN tasks included the LiSN-S and a 
Coordinate Response Measure (CRM)-based task. Evoked responses were obtained 
during an AM Change detection task using alternations between 4 and 40 Hz, 
including the N1 of the acoustic change complex, auditory steady-state response 
(ASSR), P300, and a late positive response (LP). Maturational effects were 
explored via age correlations.
RESULTS: Age correlated with 4 Hz AM thresholds, CRM Separated Talker scores, 
and N1 amplitude. Age-normed LiSN-S scores obtained without spatial or talker 
cues correlated with age-corrected 4 Hz AM thresholds and area under the LP 
curve. CRM Separated Talker scores correlated with AM thresholds and area under 
the LP curve. Most behavioral measures of AM perception correlated with the SNR 
and phase coherence of the 40 Hz ASSR. AM Change RT also correlated with area 
under the LP curve. Children with LiD exhibited deficits with respect to 4 Hz 
thresholds, AM Change accuracy, and area under the LP curve.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed relationships between AM perception and SiN 
performance extend the evidence that modulation perception is important for 
understanding SiN in childhood. In line with this finding, children with LiD 
demonstrated poorer performance on some measures of AM perception, but their 
evoked responses implicated a primarily cognitive deficit.","DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297523

architecture with real-time communication API.","Osa-Sanchez A, Jossa-Bastidas O, Mendez-Zorrilla A, Oleagordia-Ruiz I, 
Garcia-Zapirain B.","BACKGROUND: Loneliness and social isolation are recognized as critical public 
health issues. Older people are at greater risk of loneliness and social 
isolation as they deal with things like living alone, loss of family or friends, 
chronic illness, and hearing loss. Loneliness increases a person's risk of 
premature death from all causes, including dementia, heart disease, and stroke. 
To address these issues, the inclusion of technological platforms and the use of 
commercial monitoring devices are vastly increasing in healthcare and elderly 
care.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to design and develop a loneliness 
monitor serverless architecture to obtain real-time data from commercial 
activity wristbands through an Application Programming Interface.
METHODS: For the design and development of the architecture, the Amazon Web 
Services platform has been used. To monitor loneliness, the Fitbit Charge 5 
bracelet was selected. Through the web Application Programming Interface offered 
by the AWS Lambda service, the data is obtained and stored in AWS services with 
an automated frequency thanks to the event bridge.
RESULTS: In the pilot stage in which the system is, it is showing great 
possibilities in the ease of collecting data and programming the sampling 
frequency. Once the request is made, the data is automatically analyzed to 
monitor loneliness.
CONCLUSION: The proposed architecture shows great potential for easy data 
collection, analysis, security, personalization, real-time inference, and 
scalability of sensors and actuators in the future. It has powerful benefits to 
apply in the health sector and reduces cases of depression and loneliness.","DOI: 10.3233/THC-235006

fields including medicine. In diabetes, robust biosensing technologies and 
automated insulin delivery therapies have created a substantial opportunity to 
improve health. While the number of manuscripts addressing the topic of applying 
machine learning to diabetes has grown in recent years, there has been a lack of 
consistency in the methods, metrics, and data used to train and evaluate these 
algorithms. This manuscript provides consensus guidelines for machine learning 
practitioners in the field of diabetes, including best practice recommended 
approaches and warnings about pitfalls to avoid.
METHODS: Algorithmic approaches are reviewed and benefits of different 
algorithms are discussed including importance of clinical accuracy, 
explainability, interpretability, and personalization. We review the most common 
features used in machine learning applications in diabetes glucose control and 
provide an open-source library of functions for calculating features, as well as 
a framework for specifying data sets using data sheets. A review of current data 
sets available for training algorithms is provided as well as an online 
repository of data sources.
SIGNIFICANCE: These consensus guidelines are designed to improve performance and 
translatability of new machine learning algorithms developed in the field of 
diabetes for engineers and data scientists.","DOI: 10.1109/RBME.2023.3331297

engagement, adherence, and recovery. Robots can be employed to improve 
motivation through multiplayer rehabilitation games, which allow patients to 
collaborate and interact in a virtual environment through multimodal sensory 
cues. This social interaction can provide social support and increase 
motivation, resulting in better therapy engagement. A hand rehabilitation robot 
(PLUTO) was used to investigate the potential of social interaction to implement 
haptic multiplayer games. Twelve unimpaired participants (6 dyads) played in 
solo, collaborative, and competitive game modes. Surprisingly, no difference was 
found in self-reported engagement, tension, or competence between solo and 
multiplayer games. However, the IMI scale indicated that engagement for 
multiplayer games was rated higher than for solo games. The collaborative game 
was preferred by 10 out of 12 participants, highlighting its potential for 
promoting behavioural involvement and engagement. This study indicates that 
using PLUTO with multiplayer game modes can enhance therapy engagement. This can 
potentially improve rehabilitation outcomes if translated to the patient

with Reinforcement Learning.","Wannawas N, Faisal AA.","Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been increasingly integrated with 
other rehabilitation devices, including rehabilitation robots. FES cycling is 
one of the common FES applications in rehabilitation, which is performed by 
stimulating leg muscles in a certain pattern. The appropriate pattern varies 
across individuals and requires manual tuning which can be time-consuming and 
challenging for the individual user. Here, we present an AI-based method for 
finding the patterns, which requires no extra hardware or sensors. Our method 
starts with finding model-based patterns using reinforcement learning (RL) and 
customised cycling models. Next, our method fine-tunes the pattern using real 
cycling data and offline RL. We test our method both in simulation and 
experimentally on a stationary tricycle. Our method can robustly deliver 
model-based patterns for different cycling configurations. In the experimental 
evaluation, the model-based pattern can induce higher cycling speed than an 
EMG-based pattern. And by using just 100 seconds of cycling data, our method can 
deliver a fine-tuned pattern with better cycling performance. Beyond FES 
cycling, this work is a case study, displaying the feasibility and potential of 
human-in-the-loop AI in real-world rehabilitation.","DOI: 10.1109/ICORR58425.2023.10304767

positions for reaching tasks in functional movement therapy. In state-of-the-art 
solutions, these positions are determined by a motivational therapy game either 
through constraints on the end-effector (2D or 3D games), or individual arm 
joints (1D games). Consequently, these positions cannot be adapted to the 
patients' specific needs by the therapist, and the effectiveness of the training 
is reduced. We solve this issue by generating goal positions using Gaussian 
Mixture Models and probability density maps based on the active range of motion 
of the patient and desired activities, while being compliant with existing game 
constraints. Therapists can modify the goal generation via an intuitive 
difficulty and activity parameter. The pipeline was tested on the upper-limb 
exoskeleton ANYexo 2.0. We have shown that the range of motion exploration rate 
could be altered from 0.39% to 5.9% per task and that our method successfully 
generated a sequence of reaching tasks that matched the range of motion of the 
selected activity, up to an inlier accuracy of 78.9%. Results demonstrate that 
the responsibilities of the therapy game (i.e., motivating the patient) and the 
therapists (i.e., individualizing the training) could be distributed properly.

Stiffness.","Van Crey N, Cavallin M, Shepherd M, Rouse EJ.","Most commercial ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are passive structures that cannot 
modulate stiffness to assist with a diverse range of activities, such as stairs 
and ramps. It is sometimes possible to change the stiffness of passive AFOs 
through reassembly or benchtop adjustment, but they cannot change stiffness 
during use. Passive AFOs are also limited in their ankle mechanics and cannot 
replicate a biomimetic, nonlinear torque-angle relationship. Many research labs 
have developed ankle exoskeletons that show promise as viable alternatives to 
passive AFOs, but they face challenges with reliability, mass, and cost. 
Consequently, commercial translation has largely failed to date. Here we 
introduce the Variable Stiffness Orthosis (VSO), a quasi-passive variable 
stiffness ankle-foot orthosis that strikes a balance between powered and passive 
systems, in terms of mass, complexity, and onboard intelligence. The VSO has 
customizable torque-angle relationships via a cam transmission, and can make 
step-to-step stiffness adjustments via motorized reconfiguration of a spring 
support along a lead-screw. In this work, we introduce two versions: a nominal 
and a stiff prototype, which differ primarily in their mass and available 
stiffness levels. The available torque-angle relationships are measured on a 
custom dynamometer and closely match model predictions. The experimental results 
showed that the prototypes are capable of producing ankle stiffness coefficients 
between 9 - 330 Nm/rad.","DOI: 10.1109/ICORR58425.2023.10304820

Augmentation.","Zheng WZ, Han JY, Chen CY, Chang YJ, Lai YH.","Dysarthria, a speech disorder often caused by neurological damage, compromises 
the control of vocal muscles in patients, making their speech unclear and 
communication troublesome. Recently, voice-driven methods have been proposed to 
improve the speech intelligibility of patients with dysarthria. However, most 
methods require a significant representation of both the patient's and target 
speaker's corpus, which is problematic. This study aims to propose a data 
augmentation-based voice conversion (VC) system to reduce the recording burden 
on the speaker. We propose dysarthria voice conversion 3.1 (DVC 3.1) based on a 
data augmentation approach, including text-to-speech and StarGAN-VC 
architecture, to synthesize a large target and patient-like corpus to lower the 
burden of recording. An objective evaluation metric of the Google automatic 
speech recognition (Google ASR) system and a listening test were used to 
demonstrate the speech intelligibility benefits of DVC 3.1 under free-talk 
conditions. The DVC system without data augmentation (DVC 3.0) was used for 
comparison. Subjective and objective evaluation based on the experimental 
results indicated that the proposed DVC 3.1 system enhanced the Google ASR of 
two dysarthria patients by approximately [62.4%, 43.3%] and [55.9%, 57.3%] 
compared to unprocessed dysarthria speech and the DVC 3.0 system, respectively. 
Further, the proposed DVC 3.1 increased the speech intelligibility of two 
dysarthria patients by approximately [54.2%, 22.3%] and [63.4%, 70.1%] compared 
to unprocessed dysarthria speech and the DVC 3.0 system, respectively. The 
proposed DVC 3.1 system offers significant potential to improve the speech

limb-assisted robots, thereby enabling more accurate and robust decisions for 
high-level control. However, current computer vision systems in lower extremity 
devices are still constrained by the disruptions that occur in the interaction 
between human, machine, and the environment, which hinder optimal performance. 
In this paper, we propose a gimbal-based terrain classification system that can 
be adapted to different lower limb movements, different walking speeds, and gait 
phases. We use a linear active disturbance rejection controller to realize fast 
response and anti-disturbance control of the gimbal, which allows computer 
vision to continuously and stably focus on the desired field of view angle 
during lower limb motion interaction. We also deployed a lightweight MobileNetV2 
model in an embedded vision module for real-time and highly accurate inference 
performance. By using the proposed terrain classification system, it can provide 
the ability to classify and predict terrain independent of mounting position 
(thighs and shanks), gait phase, and walking speed. This also makes our system 
applicable to subjects with different physical conditions (e.g., non-disabled 
subjects and individuals with transfemoral amputation) without tuning the 
parameters, which will contribute to the plug-and-play functionality of terrain 
classification. Finally, our approach is promising to improve the adaptability 
of lower limb assisted robots in complex terrain, allowing the wearer to walk

and neural prosthetics, with sensing channel counts constantly increasing. These 
Investigations place increasing demands for high data rates and low-power 
implantable devices despite high tissue losses. The Impulse radio ultra- 
wideband (IR-UWB), a revived wireless technology for short-range radios, has 
been widely used in various applications. Since the requirements and solutions 
are application-oriented, in this review paper we focus on neural recording 
implants with high-data rates and ultra-low power requirements. We examine in 
detail the working principle, design methodology, performance, and 
implementations of different architectures of IR-UWB transceivers in a 
quantitative manner to draw a deep comparison and extract the bottlenecks and 
possible solutions concerning the dedicated application. Our analysis shows that 
current solutions rely on enhanced or combined modulation techniques to improve 
link margin. An in-depth study of prior-art publications that achieved Gbps data 
rates concludes that edge-combination architecture and non-coherent detectors 
are remarkable for transmitter and receiver, respectively. Although the aim to 
minimize power and improve data rate - defined as energy efficiency (pJ/b) - 
extending communication distance despite high tissue losses and limited power 
budget, good narrow-band interference (NBI) tolerance coexisted in the same 
frequency band of UWB systems, and compatibility with energy harvesting designs 
are among the critical challenges remained unsolved. Furthermore, we expect that 
the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and the inherent advantages of 
UWB radios will pave the way for future improvements in BMIs.","DOI: 10.1109/TBCAS.2023.3331049

shown good performance for motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interfaces (BCI) 
using electroencephalogram (EEG) in end-to-end learning. Although a few 
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have been developed, it is 
still challenging to interpret the CNN models for EEG-based BCI classification 
effectively. In this research, we propose 3D-EEGNet as a 3D CNN model to improve 
both the explainability and performance of MI EEG classification. The proposed 
approach exhibited better performances on two MI EEG datasets than the existing 
EEGNet, which uses a 2D input shape. The MI classification accuracies are 
improved around 1.8% and 6.1% point in average on the datasets, respectively. 
The permutation-based XAI method is first applied for the reliable explanation 
of the 3D-EEGNet. Next, to find a faster XAI method for spatio-temporal 
explanation, we design a novel technique based on the normalized discounted 
cumulative gain (NDCG) for selecting the best among a few saliency-based methods 
due to their higher time complexity than the permutation-based method. Among the 
saliency-based methods, DeepLIFT was selected because the NDCG scores indicated 
its results are the most similar to the permutation-based results. Finally, the 
fast spatio-temporal explanation using DeepLIFT provides deeper understanding 
for the classification results of the 3D-EEGNet and the important properties in 
the MI EEG experiments.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3330922

become a significant challenge. Transfer learning (TL) offers a promising 
solution by leveraging knowledge across different domains/tasks, effectively 
addressing data scarcity. However, TL encounters computational and communication 
challenges in resource-constrained scenarios, and negative transfer (NT) can 
arise from specific data distributions. This article presents a novel focus on 
maximizing the accuracy of instance-based TL in multisource resource-constrained 
environments while mitigating NT, a key concern in TL. Previous studies have 
overlooked the impact of resource consumption in addressing the NT problem. To 
address these challenges, we introduce an optimization model named multisource 
resource-constrained optimized TL (MSOPTL), which employs a convex combination 
of empirical sources and target errors while considering feasibility and 
resource constraints. Moreover, we enhance one of the generalization error upper 
bounds in domain adaptation setting by demonstrating the potential to substitute 
the H ∆ H divergence with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We utilize this 
enhanced error upper bound as one of the feasibility constraints of MSOPTL. Our 
suggested model can be applied as a versatile framework for various ML methods. 
Our approach is extensively validated in a neural network (NN)-based 
classification problem, demonstrating the efficiency of MSOPTL in achieving the 
desired trade-offs between TL's benefits and associated costs. This advancement 
holds tremendous potential for enhancing edge artificial intelligence (AI)

untrimmed videos, representing a fundamental step in the field of intelligent 
video understanding. With the advent of deep learning, backbone networks have 
been instrumental in providing representative spatiotemporal features, while the 
end-to-end learning paradigm has enabled the development of high-quality models 
through data-driven training. Both supervised and weakly supervised learning 
approaches have contributed to the rapid progress of temporal action 
localization, resulting in a multitude of methods and a large body of 
literature, making a comprehensive survey a pressing necessity. This paper 
presents a thorough analysis of existing action localization works, offering a 
well-organized taxonomy that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each 
strategy. In the realm of supervised learning, in addition to the anchor 
mechanism, we introduce a novel classification mechanism to categorize and 
summarize existing works. Similarly, for weakly supervised learning, we extend 
the traditional pre-classification and post-classification mechanisms by 
providing a fresh perspective on enhancement strategies. Furthermore, we shed 
light on the bottleneck of confidence estimation, a critical yet overlooked 
aspect of current works. By conducting detailed analyses, this survey serves as 
a valuable resource for researchers, providing beneficial guidance to newcomers 
and inspiring seasoned researchers alike.","DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3330794

E, Zhao C, Qian J, Cho K, He H, Sun Q, Vo H, Bello J, Krone M, Silva C.","The concept of augmented reality (AR) assistants has captured the human 
imagination for decades, becoming a staple of modern science fiction. To pursue 
this goal, it is necessary to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods 
that simultaneously perceive the 3D environment, reason about physical tasks, 
and model the performer, all in real-time. Within this framework, a wide variety 
of sensors are needed to generate data across different modalities, such as 
audio, video, depth, speech, and time-of-flight. The required sensors are 
typically part of the AR headset, providing performer sensing and interaction 
through visual, audio, and haptic feedback. AI assistants not only record the 
performer as they perform activities, but also require machine learning (ML) 
models to understand and assist the performer as they interact with the physical 
world. Therefore, developing such assistants is a challenging task. We propose 
ARGUS, a visual analytics system to support the development of intelligent AR 
assistants. Our system was designed as part of a multi-year-long collaboration 
between visualization researchers and ML and AR experts. This co-design process 
has led to advances in the visualization of ML in AR. Our system allows for 
online visualization of object, action, and step detection as well as offline 
analysis of previously recorded AR sessions. It visualizes not only the 
multimodal sensor data streams but also the output of the ML models. This allows 
developers to gain insights into the performer activities as well as the ML 
models, helping them troubleshoot, improve, and fine-tune the components of the 
AR assistant.","DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327396

dental implants primary stability and immediate loading feasibility: an in vitro 
pilot study.","Degidi M, Daprile G.","PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the correspondence between 
an Artificial Intelligence driven new tool prediction and the clinician's 
evaluation in the immediate loading suitability of curves recorded during 
implant insertion in an in vitro test. The secondary aim is to analyse peak 
insertion torque (pIT) and variable torque work (VTW) values of the implants 
used for the in vitro study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on artificial bone blocks of solid 
rigid polyurethane without cortical layer with four different densities. Five 
types of implants with different macrogeometries were used. A total of 140 
implants (7 implants of each type in the four polyurethane blocks) were 
inserted. Immediately after implant placement the insertion curves were 
classified by the operator as suitable or non-suitable for immediate loading. In 
a second moment the same curves were analyzed by the new AIT that classified 
them as belonging to YES or NO class. For each implant pIT and VTW were also 
recorded.
RESULTS: The correspondence between surgeon and AIT evaluation was 99,3% with 
only one false-negative reported by the algorithm analysis. The sensitivity 
resulted 98.95%, the specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and 
negative predictive value 97.8%. Mean pIT of the whole sample was 34.19 + 19.43 
Ncm while mean VTW was 2266.89 + 1993.73 Ncm. Statistically significant 
differences were found between implant systems in the whole sample and when 
divided by polyurethane block density.
CONCLUSIONS: AIT showed a high level of accuracy in the prediction of immediate 
loading suitability of insertion curves examined. All the implants used in the 
in vitro test were able to reach good levels of primary stability, excluding 
when inserted in the less dense polyurethane block. Clinical studies conducted 
in larger samples and with more surgeons involved are necessary to confirm these 
results.","DOI: 10.11607/jomi.10597

Detection and Tracking.","Zhang C, Wang H, Chen L, Li Y, Cai Y.","The performance of environmental perception is critical for the safe driving of 
intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). Currently, the most prevalent technical 
solutions are based on multimodal data fusion to achieve a comprehensive 
perception of the surrounding environment. However, existing fusion perception 
methods suffer from issues such as low sensor data utilization and unreasonable 
fusion strategies, which severely limit their performance in adverse weather 
conditions. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel multimodal 
data fusion framework called MixedFusion. In this framework, we introduce two 
innovative fusion strategies for the data characteristics of each sensor: 
high-level semantic guidance (HLSG) and multipriority matching (MPM). It not 
only realizes the efficient utilization of the multimodal data but also further 
realizes the complementary fusion between the multimodal data. We perform 
extensive experiments on the nuScenes and K-radar datasets. The experimental 
results demonstrate that the fusion framework proposed in this article 
significantly improves the performance of 3-D object detection and tracking in 
severe weather conditions.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3325527

applications in medicine and healthcare. Various AI-based algorithms have shown 
astonishing performance. However, in various data-driven smart healthcare 
algorithms, the problem of incomplete dataset remains a huge challenge. In this 
paper, we propose a data completeness enhancement algorithm based on generative 
AI (i.e., GenAI-DAA) to solve the problems of the in-sufficient data for model 
training, the data imbalance, and the biases of the training samples. We first 
construct the cognitive field of the generative models and effectively 
understand the state of incomplete cognition in generative models. Secondly, on 
this basis, we propose a quest algorithm for abnormal samples in the cognitive 
field based on local outlier factor. By fine-grained value evaluation, abnormal 
samples are given more refined attention. Finally, integrating the above process 
through multiple cognitive adjustments, GenAI-DAA gradually improves the 
cognitive ability. GenAI-DAA can be summarized as ""Quest-→Estimate-→Tune-up"". We 
have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our 
proposed algorithm, and shown widely applications to some typical data-driven 
smart healthcare algorithms.","DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3327485

Children.","Lin X, Wang G, Shen S, Zhan J.","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review recent developments in the diagnosis and 
treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD )and provide insights for its 
clinical management.
METHODS: The literatures were researched fro the pubmed, Wanfang and CNKI. We 
searched for research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis (screening and 
evaluation), and treatment of Autism spectrum disorder. When selecting papers to 
be included, priority should be given to randomized clinical trials, systematic 
evaluations, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines, and articles related 
to general medical readers.
RESULTS: ASD is a widely present neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
social and communication difficulties, narrow interests, and repetitive 
behavior, accompanied by symptoms such as irritability, self-harm, attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep problems. Irritability, 
self-harm, ADHD, and sleep problems are common accompanying symptoms that 
contribute to the challenges faced by individuals with ASD. At present, there is 
no fully effective treatment method for ASD, and key factors affecting the 
prognosis of ASD include early diagnosis time, early language communication 
level, intelligence level, disease severity, comorbidities, family 
participation, appropriate intervention, and social support. Therefore, early 
individualized long-term comprehensive training and drug therapy, hyperbaric 
oxygen therapy, and combined family participation can improve the prognosis of 
pediatric patients. Before selecting treatment plans for children, collecting as 
much information as possible about various treatment methods and choosing 
personalized treatment plans based on the child's developmental assessment level 
is necessary. In addition, the treatment of ASD is also influenced by factors 
such as family economic status, parental mentality, and social environment. 
During the training process, it is important to be family-centered, tolerant, 
and understand children's behavior.
CONCLUSION: It is significant to take effective treatment measures to improve 
the quality of life and prognosis of children with autism spectrum disorders.",PMID: 37883758

Segmentation.","Pei G, Shen F, Yao Y, Chen T, Hua XS, Shen HT.","The optical flow guidance strategy is ideal for obtaining motion information of 
objects in the video. It is widely utilized in video segmentation tasks. 
However, existing optical flow-based methods have a significant dependency on 
optical flow, which results in poor performance when the optical flow estimation 
fails for a particular scene. The temporal consistency provided by the optical 
flow could be effectively supplemented by modeling in a structural form. This 
paper proposes a new hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture, 
dubbed hierarchical graph pattern understanding (HGPU), for zero-shot video 
object segmentation (ZS-VOS). Inspired by the strong ability of GNNs in 
capturing structural relations, HGPU innovatively leverages motion cues (i.e., 
optical flow) to enhance the high-order representations from the neighbors of 
target frames. Specifically, a hierarchical graph pattern encoder with message 
aggregation is introduced to acquire different levels of motion and appearance 
features in a sequential manner. Furthermore, a decoder is designed for 
hierarchically parsing and understanding the transformed multi-modal contexts to 
achieve more accurate and robust results. HGPU achieves state-of-the-art 
performance on four publicly available benchmarks (DAVIS-16, YouTube-Objects, 
Long-Videos and DAVIS-17). Code and pre-trained model can be found at

surface defect inspection has been increasing. Deep learning has achieved 
promising results in defect inspection. However, due to the rareness of defect 
data and the difficulties of pixelwise annotation, the existing supervised 
defect inspection methods are too inferior to be implemented in practice. To 
solve the problem of defect segmentation with few labeled data, we propose a 
simple and efficient method for semisupervised defect segmentation (SSDS), named 
perturbed progressive learning (PPL). On the one hand, PPL decouples the 
predictions of student and teacher networks as well as alleviates overfitting on 
noisy pseudo-labels. On the other hand, PPL encourages consistency across 
various perturbations in a broader stagewise scope, alleviating drift caused by 
the noisy pseudo-labels. Specifically, PPL contains two training stages. In the 
first stage, the teacher network gives the unlabeled data with pseudo-labels 
that are divided into the easy and hard groups. The labeled data and the 
unlabeled data in the easy group with their perturbation are both used to train 
for a better-performing student network. In the second stage, the unlabeled data 
in the hard group are predicted by the obtained student network, so the refined 
pseudo-labeled data are enlarged. All the pseudo-labeling data and labeled data 
with their perturbation are used to retrain the student network, progressively 
improving the defect feature representation. We build a mobile screen defect 
dataset (MSDD-3) with three classes of defects. PPL is implemented on MSDD-3 as 
well as other public datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that 
PPL significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation 
partition protocols.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3324188

(ECG)-based automatic cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis. Multi-lead ECG 
signals have lead systems based on the potential differences between electrodes 
placed on the limbs and the chest. When applying DL models, ECG signals are 
usually treated as synchronized signals arranged in Euclidean space, which is 
the abstraction and generalization of real space. However, conventional DL 
models typically merely focus on temporal features when analyzing Euclidean 
data. These approaches ignore the spatial relationships of different leads, 
which are physiologically significant and useful for CVD diagnosis because 
different leads represent activities of specific heart regions. These 
relationships derived from spatial distributions of electrodes can be 
conveniently created in non-Euclidean data, making multi-lead ECGs better 
conform to their nature. Considering graph convolutional network (GCN) adept at 
analyzing non-Euclidean data, a novel spatial-temporal residual GCN for CVD 
diagnosis is proposed in this work. ECG signals are firstly divided into 
single-channel patches and transferred into nodes, which will be connected by 
spatial-temporal connections. The proposed model employs residual GCN blocks and 
feed-forward networks to alleviate over-smoothing and over-fitting. Moreover, 
residual connections and patch dividing enable the capture of global and 
detailed spatial-temporal features. Experimental results reveal that the 
proposed model achieves at least a 5.85% and 6.80% increase in F1 over other 
state-of-the-art algorithms with similar parameters and computations in both 
PTB-XL and Chapman databases. It indicates that the proposed model provides a

Decision Making.","Oral E, Chawla R, Wijkstra M, Mahyar N, Dimara E.","In the face of complex decisions, people often engage in a three-stage process 
that spans from (1) exploring and analyzing pertinent information 
(intelligence); (2) generating and exploring alternative options (design); and 
ultimately culminating in (3) selecting the optimal decision by evaluating 
discerning criteria (choice). We can fairly assume that all good visualizations 
aid in the ""intelligence"" stage by enabling data exploration and analysis. Yet, 
to what degree and how do visualization systems currently support the other 
decision making stages, namely ""design"" and ""choice""? To further explore this 
question, we conducted a comprehensive review of decision-focused visualization 
tools by examining publications in major visualization journals and conferences, 
including VIS, EuroVis, and CHI, spanning all available years. We employed a 
deductive coding method and in-depth analysis to assess whether and how 
visualization tools support design and choice. Specifically, we examined each 
visualization tool by (i) its degree of visibility for displaying decision 
alternatives, criteria, and preferences, and (ii) its degree of flexibility for 
offering means to manipulate the decision alternatives, criteria, and 
preferences with interactions such as adding, modifying, changing mapping, and 
filtering. Our review highlights the opportunities and challenges that 
decision-focused visualization tools face in realizing their full potential to 
support all stages of the decision making process. It reveals a surprising 
scarcity of tools that support all stages, and while most tools excel in 
offering visibility for decision criteria and alternatives, the degree of 
flexibility to manipulate these elements is often limited, and the lack of tools 
that accommodate decision preferences and their elicitation is notable. Based on 
our findings, to better support the choice stage, future research could explore 
enhancing flexibility levels and variety, exploring novel visualization 
paradigms, increasing algorithmic support, and ensuring that this automation is 
user-controlled via the enhanced flexibility levels. Our curated list of the 88

reconstruction. Nevertheless, improvements throughout the entire processing, 
from signal detection to computation, potentially offer significant benefits. 
This work presents a novel and versatile approach to detector optimization using 
machine learning (ML) and residual physics. We apply the concept to positron 
emission tomography (PET), intending to improve the coincidence time resolution 
(CTR). PET visualizes metabolic processes in the body by detecting photons with 
scintillation detectors. Improved CTR performance offers the advantage of 
reducing radioactive dose exposure for patients. Modern PET detectors with 
sophisticated concepts and read-out topologies represent complex physical and 
electronic systems requiring dedicated calibration techniques. Traditional 
methods primarily depend on analytical formulations successfully describing the 
main detector characteristics. However, when accounting for higher-order 
effects, additional complexities arise matching theoretical models to 
experimental reality. Our work addresses this challenge by combining traditional 
calibration with AI and residual physics, presenting a highly promising 
approach. We present a residual physics-based strategy using gradient tree 
boosting and physics-guided data generation. The explainable AI framework 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAPs) was used to identify known physical 
effects with learned patterns. In addition, the models were tested against basic 
physical laws. We were able to improve the CTR significantly (more than 20%) for 
clinically relevant detectors of 19 mm height, reaching CTRs of 185 ps (450-550

Correlation Fusion With a Temporal Alignment Mechanism.","Hou K, Zhang X, Yang Y, Zhao Q, Yuan W, Zhou Z, Zhang S, Li C, Shen J, Hu B.","Modeling correlations between multimodal physiological signals e.g., canonical 
correlation analysis (CCA) for emotion recognition has attracted much attention. 
However, existing studies rarely consider the neural nature of emotional 
responses within physiological signals. Furthermore, during fusion space 
construction, the CCA method maximizes only the correlations between different 
modalities and neglects the discriminative information of different emotional 
states. Most importantly, temporal mismatches between different neural 
activities are often ignored; therefore, the theoretical assumptions that 
multimodal data should be aligned in time and space before fusion are not 
fulfilled. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative correlation 
fusion method coupled with a temporal alignment mechanism for multimodal 
physiological signals. We first use neural signal analysis techniques to 
construct neural representations of the central nervous system (CNS) and 
autonomic nervous system (ANS). respectively. Then, emotion class labels are 
introduced in CCA to obtain more discriminative fusion representations from 
multimodal neural responses, and the temporal alignment between the CNS and ANS 
is jointly optimized with a fusion procedure that applies the Bayesian 
algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly 
improves the emotion recognition performance. Additionally, we show that this 
fusion method can model the underlying mechanisms in human nervous systems 
during emotional responses, and our results are consistent with prior findings. 
This study may guide a new approach for exploring human cognitive function based 
on physiological signals at different time scales and promote the development of 
computational intelligence and harmonious human-computer interactions.","DOI: 10.1109/TCYB.2023.3320107

magnetorheological finishing using robots.","Cheng R, Li L, Xue D, Li X, Bai Y, Luo X, Zhang X.","Industrial robots with six degrees-of-freedom have significant potential for use 
in optical manufacturing owing to their flexibility, low cost, and high space 
utilisation. However, the low trajectory accuracy of robots affects the 
manufacturing accuracy of optical components when combined with 
magnetorheological finishing (MRF). Moreover, general robot trajectory-error 
compensation methods cannot compensate for the running errors of large robots 
with high precision. To address this problem, a three-dimensional (3D) tool 
influence function (TIF) model based on inverse distance interpolation is 
developed in this study to accurately predict the TIF of different polishing 
gaps. A high-precision robot-MRF polishing strategy based on variable TIFs and 
surface shape accuracy of polished optics is proposed to achieve high-precision 
manufacturing without compensating for trajectory errors. Subsequently, the 
accuracy of a ϕ420 mm fused silica mirror is experimentally verified to be from 
0.11 λ RMS to 0.013 λ RMS. This validates that the robot-MRF can achieve 
high-precision polishing without compensating for trajectory errors. 
Furthermore, the proposed model will promote the applications of industrial 
robots in optical manufacturing and will serve as a reference in the field of 
intelligent optical manufacturing.","DOI: 10.1364/OE.498458

is asked. In this paper, a novel self-adaptive wide-FoV receiver involving

range of the receiver can be expanded by dynamically adjusting the incident 
light directions with the assistance of RIS. Based on the maximum arrived flux

mortality. Gait, or human walking, is a significant predictor of quality of 
life, morbidity, and mortality. Gait patterns and other kinematic, kinetic, and 
balance gait features are accurate and powerful diagnostic and prognostic tools.
OBJECTIVE: This review article focuses on the applicability of gait analysis 
using fusion techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) models. The aim is to 
examine the significance of mixing several types of wearable and non-wearable 
sensor data and the impact of this combination on the performance of AI models.
METHOD: In this systematic review, 66 studies using more than two modalities to 
record and analyze gait were identified. 40 studies incorporated multiple gait 
analysis modalities without the use of artificial intelligence to extract gait 
features such as kinematic, kinetic, margin of stability, temporal, and spatial 
gait parameters, as well as cerebral activity. Similarly, 26 studies analyzed 
gait data using multimodal fusion sensors and AI algorithms.
RESULTS: The research summarized here demonstrates that the quality of gait 
analysis and the effectiveness of AI models can both benefit from the 
integration of data from many sensors. Meanwhile, the utilization of EMG signals 
in fusion data is especially advantageous.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this review suggest that a smart, portable, 
wearable-based gait and balance assessment system can be developed using 
multimodal sensing of the most cutting-edge, clinically relevant tools and 
technology available. The information presented in this article may serve as a 
vital springboard for such development.","DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3325215

Trustworthy Fault Diagnosis of Industrial Processes.","Chen D, Xie Z, Liu R, Yu W, Hu Q, Li X, Ding SX.","Deep learning (DL) methods have been widely applied to intelligent fault 
diagnosis of industrial processes and achieved state-of-the-art performance. 
However, fault diagnosis with point estimate may provide untrustworthy 
decisions. Recently, Bayesian inference shows to be a promising approach to 
trustworthy fault diagnosis by quantifying the uncertainty of the decisions with 
a DL model. The uncertainty information is not involved in the training process, 
which does not help the learning of highly uncertain samples and has little 
effect on improving the fault diagnosis performance. To address this challenge, 
we propose a Bayesian hierarchical graph neural network (BHGNN) with an 
uncertainty feedback mechanism, which formulates a trustworthy fault diagnosis 
on the Bayesian DL (BDL) framework. Specifically, BHGNN captures the epistemic 
uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty via a variational dropout approach and 
utilizes the uncertainty information of each sample to adjust the strength of 
the temporal consistency (TC) constraint for robust feature learning. Meanwhile, 
the BHGNN method models the process data as a hierarchical graph (HG) by 
leveraging the interaction-aware module and physical topology knowledge of the 
industrial process, which integrates data with domain knowledge to learn fault 
representation. Moreover, the experiments on a three-phase flow facility (TFF) 
and secure water treatment (SWaT) show superior and competitive performance in 
fault diagnosis and verify the trustworthiness of the proposed method.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3319468

METHODS: This study used a single-group pre-test/post-test design and applied 
mining techniques to analyze the weight and probability of interaction among 
various medicines. Data were collected from 258 participants at a teaching 
hospital in northern Taiwan using convenience sampling. An app was used to give

Person-Centered Framework.","Aultman JM, Raimer PL, Grossoehme DH, Nofziger RA, Ba A, Friebert S.","AbstractThere is a critical need to establish a space to engage in careful 
deliberation amid exciting, important, necessary, and groundbreaking 
technological and clinical advances in pediatric medicine. Extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is one such technology that began in pediatric 
settings nearly 50 years ago. And while not void of medical and ethical 
examination, both the symbolic progression of medicine that ECMO embodies and 
its multidimensional challenges to patient care require more than an 
intellectual exercise. What we illustrate, then, is a person-centered framework 
that incorporates the philosophy and practice of palliative care and care-based 
ethical approaches. This person-centered framework is valuable for identifying 
and understanding challenges central to ECMO, guides collaborative 
decision-making, and recognizes the value of relationships within and between 
patients, families, healthcare teams, and others who impact and are impacted by 
ECMO. Specifically, this person-centered approach enables caregivers to provide 
compassionate and effective support in critical, and often urgent, situations 
where conflicts may emerge among healthcare team members, families, and other 
decision makers. By reflecting on three cases based on actual situations, we 
apply our person-centered framework and identify those aspects that were 
utilized in and informed this project. We aim to fill a current gap in the 
pediatric ECMO literature by presenting a person-centered framework that 
promotes caregiving relationships among hospitalized critically ill children, 
families, and the healthcare team and is supported through the philosophy and 
practice of palliative care and clinical ethics.","DOI: 10.1086/726811

Multisensory Mutual Associative Learning Networks.","Jiang M, Zeng Z.","Memory is vital and indispensable for organisms and brain-inspired intelligence 
to gain complete sensation and cognition of the environment. In this work, a 
memristive bionic memory circuit inspired by human memory model is proposed, 
which includes 1) receptor and sensory neuron (SN), 2) short-term memory (STM) 
module, and 3) long-term memory (LTM) module. By leveraging the in-memory 
computing characteristic of memristors, various functions such as sensation, 
learning, forgetting, recall, consolidation, reconsolidation, retrieval, and 
reset are realized. Besides, a multisensory mutual associative learning network 
is constructed with several bionic memory units to memorize and associate 
sensory information of different modalities bidirectionally. Except for 
association establishment, enhancement, and extinction, we also mimicked 
multisensory integration to manifest the synthetic process of information from 
different sensory channels. According to the simulation results in PSPICE, the 
proposed circuit performs high robustness, low area overhead, and low power 
consumption. Combining associative memory with human memory model, this work 
provides a possible idea for further research in associative learning networks.","DOI: 10.1109/TBCAS.2023.3324574

Conditional Adversarial Learning Model.","Ma C, Xu Y, Zhang P, Song F, Sun Y, Feng Y, He Y, Zhang G.","The blood pressure (BP) waveform is a vital source of physiological and 
pathological information concerning the cardiovascular system. This study 
proposes a novel attention-guided conditional generative adversarial network 
(cGAN), named PPG2BP-cGAN, to estimate BP waveforms based on 
photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The proposed model comprises a generator and 
a discriminator. Specifically, the UNet3+-based generator integrates a 
full-scale skip connection structure with a modified polarized self-attention 
module based on a spatial-temporal attention mechanism. Additionally, its 
discriminator comprises PatchGAN, which augments the discriminative power of the 
generated BP waveform by increasing the perceptual field through fully 
convolutional layers. We demonstrate the superior BP waveform prediction 
performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) 
techniques on two independent datasets. Our approach first pre-trained on a 
dataset containing 683 subjects and then tested on a public dataset. 
Experimental results from the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in 
Intensive Care dataset show that the proposed method achieves a root mean square 
error of 3.54, mean absolute error of 2.86, and Pearson coefficient of 0.99 for 
BP waveform estimation. Furthermore, the estimation errors (mean error ± 
standard deviation error) for systolic BP and diastolic BP are 0.72 ± 4.34 mmHg 
and 0.41 ± 2.48 mmHg, respectively, meeting the American Association for the 
Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standard. Our approach exhibits 
significant superiority over SOTA techniques on independent datasets, thus 
highlighting its potential for future applications in continuous cuffless BP 
waveform measurement.","DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3324319

Than 30 mm.","Mo E, Chen Z, Feng K, Yang F, Li J, Zhao YE.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of newer online intraocular lens (IOL) 
formulas in extremely elongated eyes (axial length > 30 mm).
METHODS: This retrospective case series study included 236 patients (236 eyes). 
Postoperative refractive outcomes of the Barrett Universal II (BU II), Cooke K6 
(K6), Emmetropia Verifying Optical (EVO) 2.0, Hoffer QST (HQST), Kane, 
Pearl-DGS, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) 3.0 formulas were compared. Subgroup 
analysis was performed in the extreme myopia group 1 (30 < axial length ≤ 32 
mm), extreme myopia group 2 (32 < axial length ≤ 35 mm), and meniscus IOL group. 
The root mean square absolute prediction error (RMSAE) and proportions of eyes 
of prediction errors within ±0.50 diopters (D) were calculated for statistical 
analysis.
RESULTS: For the extreme myopia group 1, RBF 3.0 achieved the lowest RMSAE 
(0.361) and EVO 2.0 showed the highest proportion of eyes within ±0.50 diopters 
(85.06%). For the extreme myopia group 2, the RMSAE of the K6 (0.442) and EVO 
2.0 (0.475) was significantly lower than the BU II (0.610), Kane (0.641), and 
HQST (0.759, P ≤ .016) formulas. In the meniscus IOL group, the K6 formula 
showed the lowest RMSAE (0.402) and the highest percentage within ±0.50 diopters 
(84.31%).
CONCLUSIONS: The EVO 2.0 and K6 formulas are recommended for IOL power 
calculation in eyes with extreme myopia. Modern artificial intelligence-based 
formulas should be used cautiously when the axial length is longer than 32 mm or 
meniscus IOLs are implanted. [J Refract Surg. 2023;39(10):705-710.].","DOI: 10.3928/1081597X-20230831-03

applications such as image classification and object recognition. However, a 
growing number of studies have shown that there exist adversarial examples in 
DNNs, which are almost imperceptibly different from the original samples but can 
greatly change the output of DNNs. Recently, many white-box attack algorithms 
have been proposed, and most of the algorithms concentrate on how to make the 
best use of gradients per iteration to improve adversarial performance. In this 
article, we focus on the properties of the widely used activation function, 
rectified linear unit (ReLU), and find that there exist two phenomena (i.e., 
wrong blocking and over transmission) misguiding the calculation of gradients 
for ReLU during backpropagation. Both issues enlarge the difference between the 
predicted changes of the loss function from gradients and corresponding actual 
changes and misguide the optimized direction, which results in larger 
perturbations. Therefore, we propose a universal gradient correction adversarial 
example generation method, called ADV-ReLU, to enhance the performance of 
gradient-based white-box attack algorithms such as fast gradient signed method 
(FGSM), iterative FGSM (I-FGSM), momentum I-FGSM (MI-FGSM), and variance tuning 
MI-FGSM (VMI-FGSM). Through backpropagation, our approach calculates the 
gradient of the loss function with respect to the network input, maps the values 
to scores, and selects a part of them to update the misguided gradients. 
Comprehensive experimental results on ImageNet and CIFAR10 demonstrate that our 
ADV-ReLU can be easily integrated into many state-of-the-art gradient-based 
white-box attack algorithms, as well as transferred to black-box attacks, to 
further decrease perturbations measured in the l2 -norm.","DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3315414

paradigm to reformulate this task in two-stage: first mapping pixels to an 
intermediate space spanned by atomic activity primitives, then programming 
detected primitives with interpretable logic rules to infer semantics. To afford 
a representative primitive space, we build a knowledge base including 26+ M

esthetic crown lengthening and control tooth preparation.
CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: After the initial intraoral and face scans, an esthetic 
treatment plan was performed digitally based on the patient's personality and 
face type using artificial intelligence-based 3D smile design software. A 
3D-printed tray relined with silicone over a 3D-printed model was used for the 
mock-up. A 3D-printed guide was implemented to assist esthetic crown lengthening 
by incorporating, simultaneously, information about the desired free gingival 
line and the alveolar bone level. Based on the initial planning, a set of 
reduction guides was 3D printed to check and correct the tooth preparation. 
Prior to the start of construction of the final monolithic restorations, their 
design was verified using 3D-printed prototypes. A stabilization splint was 
digitally designed and 3D printed to protect and maintain the final result.
CONCLUSIONS: Technologic advances can improve the predictability of an 
interdisciplinary esthetic approach. Digital planning can be transferred to 
clinical reality using a digital workflow, utilizing a set of appropriate 
3D-printed guides, which can help to control clinical procedures based on the 
initial planning.

mental health conditions, along with their unpreparedness for exercising active 
listening, empathy, and self-awareness in clinical situations, creates a barrier 
to achieving therapeutic nurse- patient relationships.
METHOD: A quantitative quasiexperimental study with a one-group pretest-posttest 
design was used to determine whether a low-fidelity communication simulation 
laboratory would decrease nursing students' perceived anxiety levels toward 
mental health patients and increase students' perceived empathy, self-awareness, 
and active listening levels.
RESULTS: After completing the communication simulation laboratory, students' 
anxiety decreased significantly (p < .001) and active listening increased 
significantly (p < .001); empathy and self-awareness levels were relatively 
unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Using a communication simulation laboratory effectively decreased 
nursing students' perceived anxiety levels toward patients and improved their

important cause of stroke, heart failure, and sudden death. Due to the insidious 
onset and no obvious clinical symptoms of AF, the status of AF diagnosis and 
treatment is not optimal. Early AF screening or detection is essential. Internet 
of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have driven the 
development of wearable electrocardiograph (ECG) devices used for health 
monitoring, which are an effective means of AF detection. The main challenges of 
AF analysis using ambulatory ECG include ECG signal quality assessment to select 
available ECG, the robust and accurate detection of QRS complex waves to monitor 
heart rate, and AF identification under the interference of abnormal ECG rhythm. 
Through ambulatory ECG measurement and intelligent detection technology, the 
probability of postoperative recurrence of AF can be reduced, and personalized 
treatment and management of patients with AF can be realized. This work 
describes the status of AF monitoring technology in terms of devices, 
algorithms, clinical applications, and future directions.","DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2023.3321792

Garcia LP, Manbachi A.","While significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have catalyzed 
progress across various domains, its full potential in understanding visual 
perception remains underexplored. We propose an artificial neural network dubbed 
VISION, an acronym for ""Visual Interface System for Imaging Output of Neural 
activity,"" to mimic the human brain and show how it can foster neuroscientific 
inquiries. Using visual and contextual inputs, this multimodal model predicts 
the brain's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan response to 
natural images. VISION successfully predicts human hemodynamic responses as fMRI 
voxel values to visual inputs with an accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art 
performance by 45%. We further probe the trained networks to reveal 
representational biases in different visual areas, generate experimentally 
testable hypotheses, and formulate an interpretable metric to associate these 
hypotheses with cortical functions. With both a model and evaluation metric, the 
cost and time burdens associated with designing and implementing functional 
analysis on the visual cortex could be reduced. Our work suggests that the 
evolution of computational models may shed light on our fundamental 
understanding of the visual cortex and provide a viable approach toward reliable 
brain-machine interfaces.","PMCID: PMC10557793

for autonomous vehicles, especially in safety-critical situations. As a key 
component of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is promising and 
has shown great potential in many complex tasks; however, its lack of safety 
guarantees limits its real-world applicability. Hence, further advancing 
reinforcement learning, especially from the safety perspective, is of great 
importance for autonomous driving. As revealed by cognitive neuroscientists, the 
amygdala of the brain can elicit defensive responses against threats or hazards, 
which is crucial for survival in and adaptation to risky environments. Drawing 
inspiration from this scientific discovery, we present a fear-neuro-inspired 
reinforcement learning framework to realize safe autonomous driving through 
modeling the amygdala functionality. This new technique facilitates an agent to 
learn defensive behaviors and achieve safe decision making with fewer safety 
violations. Through experimental tests, we show that the proposed approach 
enables the autonomous driving agent to attain state-of-the-art performance 
compared to the baseline agents and perform comparably to 30 certified human 
drivers, across various safety-critical scenarios. The results demonstrate the 
feasibility and effectiveness of our framework while also shedding light on the 
crucial role of simulating the amygdala function in the application of 
reinforcement learning to safety-critical autonomous driving domains.","DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3322426

in view of the prevalence of approximation errors, we investigate optimal

prove the stability of the system with approximation errors. Furthermore, an

acoustic signals are converted into electrical stimulation patterns. 
Technological and anatomical limitations, however, impose constraints on the 
signal transmission and the accurate excitation of the auditory nerve. Acoustic 
signals are degraded throughout cochlear implant processing, and electrical 
signal interactions at the electrode-neuron interface constrain spectral and 
temporal precision. In this work, we propose a novel InterlACE signal processing 
strategy to counteract the occurring limitations.
METHODS: By replacing the maxima selection of the Advanced Combination Encoder 
strategy with a method that defines spatially and temporally alternating 
channels, InterlACE can compensate for discarded signal content of the 
conventional processing. The strategy can be extended bilaterally by introducing 
synchronized timing and channel selection. InterlACE was explored unilaterally 
and bilaterally by assessing speech intelligibility and spectral resolution. 
Five experienced bilaterally implanted cochlear implant recipients participated 
in the Oldenburg Sentence Recognition Test in background noise and the spectral 
ripple discrimination task.
RESULTS: The introduced alternating channel selection methodology shows 
promising outcomes for speech intelligibility but could not indicate better 
spectral ripple discrimination.
CONCLUSION: InterlACE processing positively affects speech intelligibility, 
increases available unilateral and bilateral signal content, and may potentially 
counteract signal interactions at the electrode-neuron interface.
SIGNIFICANCE: This work shows how cochlear implant channel selection can be 
modified and extended bilaterally. The clinical impact of the modifications 
needs to be explored with a larger sample size.","DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2023.3322348

Verification.","Boudardara F, Boussif A, Meyer PJ, Ghazel M.","Neural networks (NNs) have witnessed widespread deployment across various 
domains, including some safety-critical applications. In this regard, the demand 
for verifying means of such artificial intelligence techniques is more and more 
pressing. Nowadays, the development of evaluation approaches for NNs is a hot 
topic that is attracting considerable interest, and a number of verification 
methods have been proposed. Yet, a challenging issue for NN verification is 
pertaining to the scalability when some NNs of practical interest have to be 
evaluated. This work aims to present INNAbstract, an abstraction method to 
reduce the size of NNs, which leads to improving the scalability of NN 
verification and reachability analysis methods. This is achieved by merging 
neurons while ensuring that the obtained model (i.e., abstract model) 
overapproximates the original one. INNAbstract supports networks with numerous 
activation functions. In addition, we propose a heuristic for nodes' selection 
to build more precise abstract models, in the sense that the outputs are closer 
to those of the original network. The experimental results illustrate the 
efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the existing relevant 
abstraction techniques. Furthermore, they demonstrate that INNAbstract can help 
the existing verification tools to be applied on larger networks while

Zhou et al. and Kim et al., which summarized AR research at ISMAR over the past 
two decades (1998-2017), we categorize the papers into different topics and 
identify prevailing trends. One notable finding is that wearable AR research is 
increasingly geared towards enabling broader consumer adoption. From our 
analysis, we highlight key observations related to potential future research 
areas essential for capitalizing on this trend and achieving widespread

type, while there is relatively little research on fiber surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) strain sensors. In this Letter, we propose a highly sensitive 
fiber SPR strain sensor based on an n-type structure. The strain changes the 
shape of the fiber n-type structure, causing the transmission mode of light in 
the fiber to change, thereby changing the SPR incidence angle and causing the 
SPR resonance valley wavelength to shift, achieving highly sensitive SPR strain 
sensing. The test results indicate that the strain sensing sensitivity of the 
proposed sensor reaches 21.33 pm/µε, and two n-type structures are connected in 
series to obtain a double n-type structure, further enhancing the strain sensing 
sensitivity to 33.44 pm/µε. This fiber strain sensor has advantages of high 
sensitivity, low temperature cross talk, strong structural stability, and low 
production cost, and is expected to become a new solution for wearable 
intelligent monitoring equipment and strain sensors in the aerospace field.","DOI: 10.1364/OL.500824

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), have occurred at a remarkably fast 
rate. OpenAI released its newest model of ChatGPT, GPT-4, in March 2023. It 
offers a wide range of medical applications. The model has demonstrated notable 
proficiency on many medical board examinations. This study sought to assess 
GPT-4's performance on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) used to 
prepare residents for the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I 
Examination. The data gathered from GPT-4's performance were additionally 
compared with the data of the previous iteration of ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, which was 
released 4 months before GPT-4. GPT-4 correctly answered 251 of the 396 
attempted questions (63.4%), whereas GPT-3.5 correctly answered 46.3% of 410 
attempted questions. GPT-4 was significantly more accurate than GPT-3.5 on 
orthopedic board-style questions (P<.00001). GPT-4's performance is most 
comparable to that of an average third-year orthopedic surgery resident, while 
GPT-3.5 performed below an average orthopedic intern. GPT-4's overall accuracy 
was just below the approximate threshold that indicates a likely pass on the 
ABOS Part I Examination. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in 
OpenAI's newest model, GPT-4. Future studies should assess potential clinical 
applications as AI models continue to be trained on larger data sets and offer 
more capabilities. [Orthopedics. 202x;4x(x):xx-xx.].","DOI: 10.3928/01477447-20230922-05

Predictive Performance of Time-Series Data.","Sim S, Kim D, Bae H.","Time-series forecasting (TSF) is a traditional problem in the field of 
artificial intelligence, and models such as recurrent neural network, long 
short-term memory, and gate recurrent units have contributed to improving its 
predictive accuracy. Furthermore, model structures have been proposed to combine 
time-series decomposition methods such as seasonal-trend decomposition using 
LOESS. However, this approach is learned in an independent model for each 
component, and therefore, it cannot learn the relationships between the 
time-series components. In this study, we propose a new neural architecture 
called a correlation recurrent unit (CRU) that can perform time-series 
decomposition within a neural cell and learn correlations (autocorrelation and 
correlation) between each decomposition component. The proposed neural 
architecture was evaluated through comparative experiments with previous studies 
using four univariate and four multivariate time-series datasets. The results 
showed that long- and short-term predictive performance was improved by more 
than 10%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed CRU is an 
excellent method for TSF problems compared to other neural architectures.","DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3319557

Parasitic EGG Detection in Microscopic Images.","Wan Z, Liu S, Ding F, Li M, Srivastava G, Yu K.","Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) 
technologies can facilitate automatic diagnosis and management of chronic 
diseases (e.g., intestinal parasitic infection) based on two-dimensional (2D) 
microscopic images. To improve the model performance of object detection 
challenged by microscopic image characteristics (e.g., focus failure, motion 
blur, and whether zoomed or not), we propose Coupled Composite Backbone Network 
(C2BNet) to execute the parasitic egg detection task using 2D microscopic 
images. In particular, the C2BNet backbone adopts a two-path structure-based 
backbone and leverages model heterogeneity to learn object features from 
different perspectives. A novel feature composition style is proposed to flow 
the feature within the coupled composite backbone, and ensure mutual enhancement 
of feature representation ability among the different paths of the backbone. To 
further improve the accuracy of the detection results, we propose Multiscale 
Weighted Box Fusion (WBF) to fuse the location and confidence scores of all 
bounding boxes predicted from the multiscale feature maps, and iteratively 
refine the box coordinates to form the final prediction. Experimental results on 
Chula-ParasiteEgg-11 dataset demonstrate that the C2BNet not only performs 
satisfactorily compared with state-of-the-art methods, but also can focus more 
on learning detailed morphology features and abundant semantic features, 
resulting in more precise detection for parasitic eggs located in the 2D 
microscopic image.","DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3318604

Protein-Specific Molecular Generation.","Kyro GW, Morgunov A, Brent RI, Batista VS.","The incredible capabilities of generative artificial intelligence models have 
inevitably led to their application in the domain of drug discovery. Within this 
domain, the vastness of chemical space motivates the development of more 
efficient methods for identifying regions with molecules that exhibit desired 
characteristics. In this work, we present a computationally efficient active 
learning methodology that requires evaluation of only a subset of the generated 
data in the constructed sample space to successfully align a generative model 
with respect to a specified objective. We demonstrate the applicability of this 
methodology to targeted molecular generation by fine-tuning a GPT-based 
molecular generator toward a protein with FDA-approved small-molecule 
inhibitors, c-Abl kinase. Remarkably, the model learns to generate molecules 
similar to the inhibitors without prior knowledge of their existence, and even 
reproduces two of them exactly. We also show that the methodology is effective 
for a protein without any commercially available small-molecule inhibitors, the 
HNH domain of the CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) enzyme. We believe that the 
inherent generality of this method ensures that it will remain applicable as the 
exciting field of in silico molecular generation evolves. To facilitate 
implementation and reproducibility, we have made all of our software available 
through the open-source ChemSpaceAL Python package.","PMCID: PMC10516108

Optimized Zonotope Set-Membership Filter.","Zuo J, Yang B, Xiao X, Sun C, Huang J.","As the global aging population continues to grow, there has been a significant 
increase in the number of fall-related injuries among the elderly, primarily due 
to reduced muscle strength and balance control, especially during sit-to-stand 
(STS) movements. Intelligent wearable robots have the potential to provide fall 
prevention assistance to individuals at risk, but an accurate and timely 
assessment of human movement stability is essential. This paper presents a fall 
prediction algorithm for STS movements based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) 
optimized zonotope set-membership filter (KKT-ZSMF), enabling real-time 
assessment of human stability. To quantify the feasible stability region of 
human STS movement, a mathematical model is proposed based on dynamic stability 
theory. Additionally, an online fall-prediction approach is developed, utilizing 
the zonotope set-membership filter to iteratively update the set that represents 
the instantaneous stability region. The approach incorporates a KKT optimization 
algorithm to compute the optimal convex hull, thereby enhancing the accuracy and 
efficiency of the set-membership filter. Experimental validation is conducted 
with the participation of 13 subjects including 5 elderly subjects, comparing 
the performance of the proposed KKT-ZSMF algorithm with other relevant methods. 
The results confirm the accuracy and real-time performance of the KKT-ZSMF 
algorithm for predicting human STS movement stability, achieving an overall 
prediction accuracy of 93.49% and a runtime of no more than 7.91 ms. These 
findings demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm for fall prevention 
assistance in daily activities.","DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2023.3317890

perspective to improve the spike-driven learning capability by introducing 
dendritic processing as an additional hyperparameter. Neuromorphic computing is 
an effective and essential solution towards spike-based machine intelligence and 
neural learning systems. However, on-line learning capability for neuromorphic 
models is still an open challenge. In this study a novel neuromorphic 
architecture with dendritic on-line learning (NADOL) is presented, which is a 
novel efficient methodology for brain-inspired intelligence on embedded 
hardware. With the feature of distributed processing using spiking neural 
network, NADOL can cut down the power consumption and enhance the learning 
efficiency and convergence speed. A detailed analysis for NADOL is presented, 
which demonstrates the effects of different conditions on learning capabilities, 
including neuron number in hidden layer, dendritic segregation parameters, 
feedback connection, and connection sparseness with various levels of 
amplification. Piecewise linear approximation approach is used to cut down the 
computational resource cost. The experimental results demonstrate a remarkable 
learning capability that surpasses other solutions, with NADOL exhibiting 
superior performance over the GPU platform in dendritic learning. This study's 
applicability extends across diverse domains, including the Internet of Things, 
robotic control, and brain-machine interfaces. Moreover, it signifies a pivotal 
step in bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and neuroscience 
through the introduction of an innovative neuromorphic paradigm.","DOI: 10.1109/TBCAS.2023.3316968

Tweets Related to Schizophrenia.","Dikeç G, Oban V, Barış Usta M.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to qualitatively examine Turkish tweets 
about schizophrenia in respect of stigmatization and discrimination within a 
one-month period and to conduct emotional analysis using artificial intelligence 
applications.
METHOD: Using the keyword 'schizophrenia,' Turkish tweets were gathered from the 
Python Tweepy application between December 19, 2020 and January 18, 2021. 
Features were extracted using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
Transformers (BERT) method and artificial neural networks and tweets were 
classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Approximately 5% of the tweets 
were qualitatively analyzed, constituting those most frequently liked and 
retweeted.
RESULTS: The study found that, of the total of 3406 schizophreniarelated 
messages shared in Turkey over a period of one-month, 2996 were original, and 
were then retweeted a total of 1823 times, and liked by 25,413 people. It was 
determined that 63.4% of the tweets shared about schizophrenia contained 
negative emotions, 28.7% were neutral, and 7.71% expressed positive emotions. 
Within the scope of the qualitative analysis, 145 tweets were examined and 
classified under four main themes and two sub-themes; namely, news about violent 
patients, insult (insulting people in interpersonal relationships, insulting 
people in the news), mockery, and information.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the Turkish tweets about 
schizophrenia, which were emotionally analyzed using artificial intelligence 
were found often to contain negative emotions. It was also seen that Twitter 
users used the term schizophrenia, not in a medical sense but to insult and make 
fun of individuals, frequently shared the news that patients were victims or 
perpetrators of violence, and the messages shared by professional branch 
organizations or mental health professionals were primarily for conveying 
information to the public.","DOI: 10.5080/u26402
